## ⚠️ MEDIUM - Could Work But Might Be Thin

**28. reduce burnout** ⚠️
- Therapists: burnout counselors
- Books: burnout recovery books
- Habits: boundary setting routines

**Verdict: MEDIUM - Overlaps heavily with "manage stress". Is this meaningfully different?**

**29. overcome perfectionism** ⚠️
- Therapists: CBT for perfectionism (specific)
- Books: "The Gifts of Imperfection" (specific)
- Apps: habit trackers encouraging "good enough"
**Verdict: MEDIUM - Some specific solutions but quite psychological**

(Duplicate of #30)

**33. improve family relationships** ⚠️
- Therapists: family therapy

**35. improve time management at work** ⚠️
(Similar to improve productivity)
**Verdict: MEDIUM - Might be duplicate**

## ❌ QUESTIONABLE - Too Vague/Abstract for WWFM

**36. make new friends** ❌
- Apps: Bumble BFF, Meetup
- Groups: hobby groups
- Hobbies: joining activities
- Books: social skills books

**Problem:** The "solutions" are really just venues/contexts. What would you rate? "Join a book club" isn't a product/service WWFM can track effectiveness for. This is about behavior and putting yourself out there, not a solvable problem with specific products.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too dependent on individual action and circumstance**

**37. find compatible partner** ❌
- Apps: dating apps (but everyone knows these)
- Books: dating advice books (vague)
- Coaches: dating coaches

**Problem:** This is a life outcome, not a solvable problem. Dating apps are obvious. What else? This is too circumstantial.
**Verdict: WEAK - Life outcome, not actionable goal**

**38. overcome fear of rejection** ❌
- Therapists: yes, but very specialized
- Books: maybe some self-help books
- Apps: exposure therapy apps?

**Problem:** What specific solution helps with this? This is very internal/psychological.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too abstract and psychological**

**39. improve self-esteem** ❌
- Therapists: yes
- Books: self-help books (vague)
- Apps: affirmation apps (vague)

**Problem:** Self-esteem is a very internal state. What concrete product/service improves it? Therapy yes, but beyond that it's vague self-help books and affirmation apps. Feels thin.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too psychological/internal**

**40. build resilience** ❌
- Books: resilience books (which ones specifically?)
- Therapists: yes
- Exercise: challenging activities?

**Problem:** Resilience is very abstract. What specific solution builds resilience? This is too broad.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too abstract**

**41. stop self-sabotage** ❌
- Therapists: yes, but what kind?
- Books: psychology books (vague)

**Problem:** Self-sabotage is a pattern that manifests differently for everyone. What specific solution stops it? This is very internal.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too psychological and vague**

**42. get promoted** ❌
- Books: career advancement books
- Coaches: career coaches

**Problem:** Getting promoted is an outcome dependent on: your performance, office politics, company structure, timing, your boss, budget, competitors. What specific solution gets you promoted? This is too outcome-focused rather than skill/process-focused. "Improve public speaking" or "negotiate salary" are skills. "Get promoted" is an outcome of many factors.
**Verdict: WEAK - Outcome not process, too many uncontrollable factors**

**43. increase income** ❌
- Books: side hustle books, investment books
- Courses: skill-building courses

**Problem:** Increase income HOW? Side hustle? Promotion? Different job? Investment? Freelancing? Each is completely different with completely different solutions. This is way too broad.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too broad, needs to be broken down**

**44. build wealth** ❌
- Books: wealth books (which strategy?)
- Financial products: investment accounts (but which?)
- Courses: investing courses

**Problem:** Build wealth through what? Real estate? Stocks? Business? Index funds? Day trading? These are completely different paths with different solutions. Too broad.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too broad, needs to be specific strategy**

**45. achieve financial independence** ❌
(Even broader than build wealth)
**Verdict: WEAK - Way too broad**

**46. overcome fear of failure** ❌
- Therapists: yes
- Books: self-help books (vague)

**Problem:** Very psychological and internal. What specific solution overcomes this fear?
**Verdict: WEAK - Too abstract**

**47. improve self-awareness** ❌
- Books: self-help books (vague)
- Meditation: some practices
- Therapy: yes

**Problem:** What does this even mean practically? This is extremely abstract.
**Verdict: WEAK - Too vague and abstract**

## RECOMMENDATION

**Add the 25 STRONG goals** - These have concrete, specific, rateable solutions that fit WWFM's model.

**Carefully evaluate the 8 MEDIUM goals** - Some might work (like "overcome perfectionism" which has specific CBT approaches), others might be duplicates.

**Skip the 12 WEAK goals** - These are too abstract, outcome-focused, or vague for WWFM's solution-based model. They're the type of goals you had to remove from your original 1,000.

This reduces the top 50 from 45 unique goals to **25 strong + 8 maybes = 33 maximum**, but more realistically **~28-30 solid additions** after removing duplicates and borderline cases.
