/**
 * Direct solution generation prompt with mapping table
 */
export const V2_SOLUTION_PROMPT = `Based on your training data from medical literature, clinical studies, consumer research, and general knowledge, generate {{LIMIT}} evidence-based solutions for this goal:

Goal: {{GOAL_TITLE}}
Description: {{GOAL_DESCRIPTION}}
Arena: {{ARENA}}

{{CATEGORY_FIELDS_TABLE}}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Draw from your COMPLETE training data - medical and non-medical sources
2. Include solutions you KNOW to be effective based on research, studies, and evidence
3. Be specific about effectiveness ratings based on actual data you've seen
4. Include both conventional AND alternative approaches where evidence exists
5. Rate effectiveness (3.0-5.0) based on actual research and clinical evidence:
   - 4.5-5.0: Strong evidence (RCTs, meta-analyses, widely recommended, high success rates)
   - 4.0-4.4: Good evidence (multiple studies, commonly effective, reliable results)
   - 3.5-3.9: Moderate evidence (some studies, works for many, mixed results)
   - 3.0-3.4: Limited evidence (anecdotal, works for some, variable results)
   - Below 3.0: Don't include - insufficient evidence
6. Include effectiveness_rationale to ensure ratings are evidence-based (not random)
7. Ensure diversity across categories - not all from one type
8. Include what your training data indicates ACTUALLY WORKS
9. Include ALL required fields for each category (see table above)

Return a JSON array with this structure for each solution:
{
  "title": "Solution name",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "category": "category_name_from_table",
  "effectiveness": 3.0-5.0,
  "effectiveness_rationale": "Evidence basis",
  "fields": {
    // MUST contain EXACTLY the fields from the table for this category
  },
  "variants": [] // Only for medications/supplements_vitamins/natural_remedies/beauty_skincare
}

CATEGORIES - Use EXACT strings from this list:
medications, supplements_vitamins, natural_remedies, beauty_skincare,
therapists_counselors, doctors_specialists, coaches_mentors, alternative_practitioners,
professional_services, medical_procedures, crisis_resources,
meditation_mindfulness, exercise_movement, habits_routines,
diet_nutrition, sleep, products_devices, books_courses,
apps_software, groups_communities, support_groups,
hobbies_activities, financial_products

For dosage categories (medications/supplements_vitamins/natural_remedies/beauty_skincare), include variants:
"variants": [
  {"amount": 25, "unit": "mg", "form": "tablet"},
  {"amount": 50, "unit": "mg", "form": "tablet"},
  {"amount": 100, "unit": "mg", "form": "capsule"}
]

Example for category "habits_routines" (which requires: startup_cost, ongoing_cost, time_to_results, time_commitment):
{
  "title": "Morning Routine",
  "category": "habits_routines",
  "effectiveness": 4.2,
  "effectiveness_rationale": "Multiple studies show improved productivity and mood",
  "fields": {
    "startup_cost": "Free/No startup cost",
    "ongoing_cost": "Free/No ongoing cost", 
    "time_to_results": "1-2 weeks",
    "time_commitment": "20-30 minutes",
    "challenges": ["Consistency", "Early wake times"]
  },
  "variants": []
}

Example for category "financial_products" (which requires: cost_type, financial_benefit, time_to_results, access_time):
{
  "title": "Index Fund Investment",
  "category": "financial_products",
  "effectiveness": 4.7,
  "effectiveness_rationale": "60-year historical data shows consistent 7-10% annual returns",
  "fields": {
    "cost_type": "Transaction/usage fees",
    "financial_benefit": "$100-250/month saved/earned",
    "time_to_results": "6+ months",
    "access_time": "1-3 business days",
    "challenges": ["Market volatility", "Initial capital"]
  },
  "variants": []

export const V2_DISTRIBUTION_PROMPT = `Based on your training data about real-world usage patterns, clinical data, and user experiences, generate realistic prevalence distributions for this solution.

Solution: {{SOLUTION_TITLE}}
Category: {{CATEGORY}}
Current fields: {{FIELDS}}

Create distributions that reflect:
1. How these actually distribute in practice (from studies, trials, user reports)
2. Common vs rare occurrences based on your training data
3. Typical vs atypical experiences
4. NOT random percentages - use actual patterns you've seen in research

For each field, create a distribution showing how values vary in real-world usage.
Return a JSON object where each field maps to an array of distributions:

{
  "field_name": [
    {"name": "Most common value", "percentage": 40},
    {"name": "Second most common", "percentage": 30},
    {"name": "Third option", "percentage": 20},
    {"name": "Less common", "percentage": 10}
  ]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each field's percentages MUST sum to exactly 100
- Include 3-5 items per field (based on what's common in your training data)
- Use realistic distributions (not uniform) - based on actual patterns from research
- For array fields (side_effects, challenges, barriers, issues):
  * You MUST include the EXACT values from the solution fields
  * These items must appear in the distribution with their exact names
  * Add additional realistic items to reach 100% total
- Base all percentages on actual data patterns you've seen, not arbitrary numbers
