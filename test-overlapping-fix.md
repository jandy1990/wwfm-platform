# Overlapping Text Fix Validation

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated formatArrayField function (GoalPageClient.tsx):
- Changed from using `<span className="block">` to `<div className="space-y-1">` with nested divs
- Added consistent `text-sm` class for proper text sizing
- Improved structure for better layout control

### 2. Updated CSS (globals.css):
- Increased grid column minimum width from 280px to 320px
- Increased gap between columns from 2rem to 3rem horizontal spacing
- Added `align-items: start` to prevent vertical stretching
- Added `overflow: hidden` to additional-field-item
- Improved line-height settings for nested content
- Added specific handling for .space-y-1 nested divs

## Expected Results:
- Challenges field should now display each item on a separate line with proper spacing
- Social impact and other fields with percentages should not overlap
- Grid columns should have enough space between them
- Text should wrap properly within its container

## To Test:
1. Navigate to a diet_nutrition goal page (e.g., "Reduce Anxiety")
2. Click on a solution card to switch to detailed view
3. Look for the "Reduce Caffeine Intake" solution
4. Verify that:
   - Challenges are listed clearly without overlapping
   - Social impact percentages are readable
   - All fields are properly spaced
   - No text overlaps between columns

## Additional Validation:
- Check mobile view to ensure responsive layout works
- Test other solution categories to ensure no regressions
- Verify simple view still works correctly
