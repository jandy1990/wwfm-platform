# What Worked For Me (WWFM)

A platform that organizes information by what solutions *do* rather than what they *are*, helping users discover what has actually worked for others with similar goals.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Current Deployment

The project is currently deployed at: [wwfm-platform-6t2xbo4qg-jack-andrews-projects.vercel.app](https://wwfm-platform-6t2xbo4qg-jack-andrews-projects.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
