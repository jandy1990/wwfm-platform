## Historical Context

These files represent the branding project from October 2023 - January 2025, which established WWFM's bold, minimal, high-contrast design language. The implementation is complete (92%, Phase 12 remaining for final QA).

Key achievements:
- Unified purple accent system (removed all blue)
- Bold typography hierarchy (font-black headlines)
- Strong borders (border-2) and shadows (shadow-lg)
- High contrast dark/light alternation
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
