## 🎯 Mission Statement

Generate AI-synthesized, research-based qualitative commentary to populate Community tabs on WWFM goal pages. This content will "marry the qualitative with quantitative" - complementing effectiveness ratings with authentic peer experiences.

**Success Metric:** Reading commentary inspires users to contribute their own solution experiences (conversion).

---

## 📚 Essential Context: What is WWFM?

### Platform Overview
WWFM (What Worked For Me) crowdsources solutions to life challenges:
- **47 goals** across mental health, physical health, career, finance, relationships
- **4,161 solutions** with effectiveness ratings, cost, time to results, side effects
- **Community tabs** on every goal page (currently 46/47 are EMPTY - ready for content)

### The Gap We're Filling
**Current state (Solutions tab):**
> "CBT therapy: 4.5/5 effectiveness, $150/session, 3-6 months to results"

**What's missing (Community tab):**
> The human experience between the numbers - emotional journey, unexpected challenges, what people wish they knew, temporal progression, context that matters.

**Our job:** Fill those empty Community tabs with synthetic content that feels like real peer wisdom.

---

## ✅ What's Already Complete

### 1. Research Phase - DONE ✅
**Output:** `Claude Research.md` (50+ pages)

Claude Desktop analyzed 100+ peer commentary instances across Reddit, health forums, blogs, YouTube, and AI training data to identify:
- ✅ **5 high-frequency patterns** with occurrence rates (45-70%)
- ✅ **Complete ingredient lists** for each pattern (what makes them work)
- ✅ **Authenticity framework** (3 core ingredients + 10-point checklist)
- ✅ **Generation templates** ready to use
- ✅ **Goal-type applicability** (which patterns work for which goals)

### 2. Technical Infrastructure - DONE ✅
**Analysis:** `COMMUNITY_TAB_ANALYSIS.md`

- ✅ Community tab exists on all 47 goal pages
- ✅ `goal_discussions` table in database (supports threading, voting, moderation)
- ✅ Frontend components built (`components/goal/CommunityDiscussions.tsx`)
- ✅ Authentication and moderation working
- ✅ 46/47 goals have zero discussions (blank canvas ready)

### 3. User Requirements Gathered - DONE ✅

**From scoping session with Jack:**
- **Primary goal:** "Marry qualitative with quantitative" - fill gaps between quantification
- **Journey stage:** All stages equally (pre-decision, early action, mid-journey, long-term)
- **Coverage:** Deep coverage on top 50+ goals (not breadth)
- **Specificity:** Goal-level commentary (not solution-specific pages)
- **Format:** Variable by pattern type
- **Transparency:** Very explicit AI-synthesis labeling ("AI-synthesized from 150 Reddit posts")
- **Authenticity priorities:** Emotional honesty + specific details + temporal progression
- **Success metric:** Conversion (inspires user contributions)
- **Volume:** 5-10 posts per top goal
- **Timeline:** Pre-launch (must be ready before platform goes live)

## 🎨 The Authenticity Formula (CRITICAL)

Every generated post MUST include **2 of 3** core ingredients:

### 1. Emotional Honesty
- Admitting fear, shame, anger, grief
- Acknowledging ongoing struggles
- Vulnerability about low points
- Permission for imperfection

**Examples:**
- "I was terrified," "felt like a failure"
- "Some days still suck"
- "Contemplated suicide," "stole from family"
- "I still mess up"

### 2. Specific Details
- Exact numbers: "$124,094 debt," "73 days," "3:23am," "98.9%"
- Named products/tools: "CeraVe Foaming Cleanser," "MyFitnessPal"
- Costs: "$7," "free version," "$13K wasted"
- Precise timelines: "Week 6," "15 months"
- Locations/contexts: "At my kitchen table"

### 3. Temporal Progression
- Before/during/after clearly delineated
- Checkpoints: "Week 1," "Month 3," "6 months later"
- Non-linear: "Got worse before better," "plateaued at month 6"
- Evolution: "At first I thought X, later realized Y"
- Timeline honesty: "Took 18 months, not 3 weeks"

### 10-Point Authenticity Checklist

Every post should pass **7+ of 10:**

- [ ] Includes specific number(s) (time, cost, amount, percentage)
- [ ] Names a tool/product/method by actual name
- [ ] Admits a mistake, fear, or struggle explicitly
- [ ] Shows non-linear progression (setback, plateau, or "worse before better")
- [ ] Includes unglamorous/unsexy detail (not Instagram-worthy)
- [ ] Uses first-person experience ("I," "my," not "people should")
- [ ] Has peer-to-peer disclaimer ("worked for me," "YMMV," "everyone's different")
- [ ] Mentions time investment (how long it took, not overnight)
- [ ] Acknowledges ongoing work/imperfection ("still working on," "occasionally")
- [ ] Provides specific cost or trade-off (what was sacrificed, price paid)

### Quality Control Question

**"Could this have been written by someone who didn't actually do the thing?"**
- If YES → add specificity, vulnerability, or details
- If NO → ready to publish

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### The Firewall (Never Violate This)
**Research stage:** Extract patterns and ingredients from real posts
**↓ FIREWALL ↓**
**Generation stage:** Create NEW synthetic content using patterns

**NEVER copy/paste real posts.** Always generate fresh content following ingredient templates.

### Transparency Requirements
- Mark all content as **"AI-synthesized from [X] Reddit posts/community discussions"**
- Include source attribution (subreddits, forums referenced)
- Make it VERY explicit this is research-based synthesis, not one person's story
- User preference: err on side of over-transparency

### What Destroys Authenticity (AVOID)
1. Vague time references: "Recently," "a while ago," "soon"
2. Perfect outcomes: No struggles, setbacks, or remaining challenges
3. Motivation clichés: "Just believe," "stay positive," "you got this"
4. Missing the middle: Only before/after, no journey
5. Expert positioning: "You should," "the right way" (use peer tone instead)
6. Borrowed wisdom: Sounds like it came from a book, not lived experience
7. Absence of community: No mention of resources, support, help received

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS ✅

**UPDATE:** All 5 questions have been answered! See **`IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS.md`** for complete answers.

**Quick Summary:**
- ✅ All 5 patterns as user-centric flairs ("What to Expect", "The Mindset Shift", "Lessons Learned", "My Story", "Practical Tips")
- ✅ Attribution: Simply "AI-synthesized"
- ✅ Multiple flairs allowed per post
- ✅ Goal-specific pattern distribution
- ✅ Interwoven blending for combinations

**For reference, the questions that were asked:**

### Question 1: Flair Selection
**Context:** Research identified 5 patterns with different frequencies:
- Timeline Reality (45-60%)
- Mindset Shifts (55-70%)
- Mistakes/Learned (40-55%)
- Journey Narrative (25-40%)
- Tactical Tips (15-30%)

**Question to ask Jack:**
> "Should we implement all 5 patterns as flairs, or narrow the selection?
>
> Options:
> - **A:** All 5 patterns as flairs (Timeline, Mindset, Mistakes, Journey, Tips)
> - **B:** Top 3-4 only based on frequency (e.g., Timeline, Mindset, Mistakes only)
> - **C:** Create combined flairs (e.g., 'Getting Started' = Timeline + Mistakes)"

**Why this matters:** Determines database schema design and UI badge system.

### Question 2: Source Attribution Specificity
**Context:** Jack wants "very explicit" AI-synthesis labeling.

**Question to ask Jack:**
> "For each generated post, how specific should source attribution be?
>
> Options:
> - **A:** Generic: 'Based on community research across Reddit, health forums, and blogs'
> - **B:** Specific per post: 'Synthesized from 150+ posts in r/Anxiety, r/depression, and health forums'
> - **C:** Include specific subreddit names: 'Based on patterns from r/Anxiety community discussions'
>
> Note: Option C might create legal/attribution concerns if not directly quoting."

**Why this matters:** Determines metadata structure and disclaimer text.

### Question 3: Pattern Combination Strategy
**Context:** Research shows 60% of highest-engagement posts combine 2 patterns (e.g., Timeline + Mistakes).

**Question to ask Jack:**
> "When a post combines two patterns, how should flairs work?
>
> Options:
> - **A:** Allow multiple flairs per post (like tags: 'Timeline Reality' + 'Mistakes Learned')
> - **B:** Primary flair only (pick dominant pattern even if combined)
> - **C:** Create combo flairs as distinct categories (e.g., 'Journey & Lessons')"

**Why this matters:** UI design for badges and filtering functionality.

### Question 4: Volume Distribution Per Goal
**Context:** Target is 5-10 posts per goal, with 5 pattern types available.

**Question to ask Jack:**
> "For the 5-10 posts per goal, how should we distribute patterns?
>
> Options:
> - **A:** Even distribution (2 of each pattern type)
> - **B:** Frequency-weighted (more Timeline/Mindset since 55-70%, fewer Tips since 15-30%)
> - **C:** Goal-specific mix (mental health gets more Mindset+Journey, physical health gets more Timeline+Mistakes)
>
> Research recommends: Option C using applicability guide."

**Why this matters:** Content generation planning per goal.

### Question 5: Combination Post Structure
**Context:** When combining patterns (e.g., Timeline + Mistakes), need structural guidance.

**Question to ask Jack:**
> "When we combine two patterns in one post (e.g., Timeline Reality + Mistakes Learned), how should they integrate structurally?
>
> Options:
> - **A:** Sequential (first half is timeline, second half is mistakes learned)
> - **B:** Interwoven (mistakes embedded within timeline narrative as they occur)
> - **C:** Depends on combo (different pattern pairs structure differently)
>
> Research doesn't specify - this is a structural decision."

**Why this matters:** Generation template design for combination posts.

## 🔧 After Questions Answered: Build Sequence

Once Jack answers all 5 questions:

### Step 1: Database Schema Design
Add to `goal_discussions` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE goal_discussions
ADD COLUMN is_ai_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN pattern_type TEXT, -- or array if multiple flairs
ADD COLUMN source_metadata JSONB;
```

**source_metadata structure:**
```json
{
  "type": "ai_synthesized",
  "sources": ["r/Anxiety", "r/depression", "health forums"],
  "research_date": "2025-11-09",
  "post_count_analyzed": 150,
  "pattern_types": ["timeline_reality", "mindset_shifts"]
}
```

### Step 2: Create AI User Account or System Flag
**Options:**
- Create "WWFM Research" bot user account
- OR use special system user_id for AI posts
- Design badge/avatar for AI-generated content

### Step 3: Build Content Generation Pipeline
**Files to create in `narrative-generation/`:**

1. **`pattern-templates.ts`**
   - Template functions for each of 5 patterns
   - Uses ingredient lists from research
   - Implements authenticity checklist

2. **`generate-commentary.ts`**
   - Main generation script
   - Takes goal + pattern type + optional solution focus
   - Returns synthetic post following template
   - Validates against authenticity checklist

3. **`insert-discussions.ts`**
   - Inserts generated posts into `goal_discussions`
   - Adds source metadata
   - Sets AI flag and attribution
   - Sets initial upvote counts (optional - simulate validation)

4. **`quality-validator.ts`**
   - Runs 10-point authenticity checklist
   - Flags posts that feel generic
   - Ensures 2/3 core ingredients present

### Step 4: Prototype on One Goal
**Recommend:** "Reduce anxiety" (rank #1 traffic, 55 solutions)

1. Generate 5-10 posts using pattern mix
2. Review each for authenticity (checklist)
3. Insert into database
4. View on frontend (localhost or staging)
5. Iterate based on quality assessment
6. Get Jack's approval before scaling

### Step 5: Scale to Top 50 Goals
**Process:**
1. Query database for top 50 traffic goals
2. For each goal:
   - Determine goal type (mental health, physical, career, etc.)
   - Select pattern mix based on applicability guide
   - Generate 5-10 posts
   - Validate quality
   - Insert batch
3. Archive generation logs

[OPENING EMOTION]: Brief humble acknowledgment

[PHYSICAL/MENTAL CHANGES]: What's different now vs. start (3-5 specific)

[TIMELINE BREAKDOWN]:
- Early stage (Week 1-2): [State/symptoms]
- Middle stage (Week 4-6): [Hard part, purge, plateau]
- Later stage (Month 3+): [Improvements visible]

[WHAT HELPED]: 2-4 specific interventions with names/costs

[STRUGGLES]: Ongoing challenges or context

[FUTURE-LOOKING]: What's next

[COMMUNITY CLOSING]: Thank community or encourage others
```

### Mindset Shift Template
```
[OLD BELIEF STATEMENT]: "I used to believe [specific limiting belief]"

[CONSEQUENCES]: "This thinking [held me back / caused me to]..."

[CATALYST]: "Everything changed when [specific trigger]"

[NEW BELIEF]: "Now I understand that [reframed belief]"

[BEHAVIORAL SHIFT]: "Because of this shift, I now [specific action]"

[RESULTS]: "This has helped me [outcome]"

[ONGOING WORK]: "I still catch myself [old pattern], but..."
```

### Mistakes/Learned Template
```
[CREDIBILITY OPENER]: "[Time period] [achieving goal] taught me [#] hard lessons"

[MISTAKE #1]:
- What I did: [Specific action]
- Why I did it: [Relatable reasoning]
- What happened: [Negative consequence with metrics]
- Do this instead: [Corrected approach]

[Repeat for 3-5 mistakes]

## 💬 Communication Protocol with Jack

### When Asking Questions
- **One question at a time** (don't bundle 5 questions together)
- Present options clearly (A/B/C format)
- Explain why the decision matters
- Wait for answer before proceeding

### When Building
- Show examples before scaling (get approval on 1 goal before doing 50)
- Check in when making structural decisions not covered in handover
- Flag if something in research seems unclear or contradictory
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

### When Stuck
- Review `Claude Research.md` first (most answers are there)
- Check authenticity checklist (is content feeling generic?)
- Look at pattern templates (am I following the structure?)
- Reference goal-type applicability guide (right patterns for this goal type?)

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Template Detection
**Problem:** All posts sound the same because following templates too rigidly
**Solution:** Vary structure, use human inconsistencies, mix pattern combinations

### 2. Generic Advice
**Problem:** Content feels like it could be from any health blog
**Solution:** Add specificity (exact numbers, product names), emotional honesty, unglamorous details

### 3. Missing the Firewall
**Problem:** Copying real Reddit posts
**Solution:** Use posts to extract patterns ONLY, then generate fresh content

### 4. Wrong Pattern for Goal Type
**Problem:** Using Journey Narrative for simple skill acquisition
**Solution:** Check applicability guide in research (pages 99, 203, 316, 445, 573)

### 5. Insufficient Authenticity
**Problem:** Passes only 4-5 checklist items
**Solution:** Add more specificity or vulnerability until 7+ items pass

### 6. Perfect Outcomes
**Problem:** Story ends with "and now everything is perfect"
**Solution:** Always include "still working on" or "occasional setbacks"

### 7. Expert Tone
**Problem:** Sounds prescriptive ("you should do X")
**Solution:** Use peer language ("worked for me," "YMMV," "I found")
