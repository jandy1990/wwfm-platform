# Research Brief: Qualitative Commentary Taxonomy for WWFM

**Prepared for:** Claude Desktop (Research Agent)
**Prepared by:** Claude Code (Implementation Agent)
**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Project:** WWFM Platform - Community Tab Qualitative Content Strategy

---

## 🎯 Research Objective

**Primary Goal:** Identify the **ingredients and patterns** that make qualitative peer commentary genuinely helpful for people pursuing life goals, so we can synthetically generate authentic-feeling content.

**Critical Distinction:**
We are NOT collecting posts to copy. We are identifying the **structural elements, themes, and patterns** that make commentary resonate, so we can generate new content using these ingredients.

**Deliverable:** A pattern taxonomy with:
1. **3-5 high-frequency pattern types** (most common, most valuable)
2. **Ingredient lists** for each pattern (what elements make it work)
3. **Structural templates** (how these patterns are constructed)
4. **Frequency data** (which patterns appear most across sources)
5. **Generation guidance** (how to synthetically create content following these patterns)

---

## 📊 Background Context

### What is WWFM?

WWFM (What Worked For Me) is a platform crowdsourcing solutions to life challenges. We have:
- **47 goals** (mental health, physical health, career, finance, relationships)
- **Quantitative data:** Effectiveness ratings, cost, time to results, side effects
- **Gap:** The human experience in between the numbers

### The Vision: "Marrying Qualitative with Quantitative"

**Current state:** "CBT therapy: 4.5/5 effectiveness, $150/session, 3-6 months to results"

**What's missing:** The gaps between quantification - emotional journey, unexpected challenges, context that matters, temporal progression, what people wish they'd known.

**Goal:** Fill Community tabs with AI-generated commentary that captures these gaps authentically.

### User Journey & Success Metric

**Target users:** All journey stages equally (pre-decision, early action, mid-journey, long-term)

**Primary success metric:** Conversion - reading commentary inspires users to contribute their own solution experiences

**Volume target:** 5-10 posts per top-traffic goal (50+ goals needing deep coverage)

**Timeline:** Pre-launch (must be right before platform goes live)

---

## 🔍 Core Research Question

**What are the 3-5 most frequent and valuable patterns of helpful qualitative commentary, and what ingredients make each pattern work?**

---

## 📚 Research Scope & Sources

### Source Diversity: Hunt Everywhere People Talk Openly

**1. Reddit Communities** (recent, conversational):
- r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/ADHD (mental health)
- r/loseit, r/SkincareAddiction, r/insomnia (physical health)
- r/stopdrinking, r/leaves (behavior change)
- r/personalfinance, r/povertyfinance (financial)
- Look for: "What I wish I knew", update posts, advice threads

**2. Health Forums & Communities** (established, diverse voices):
- WebMD forums, Healthboards, MDJunction
- Patient.info forums, DailyStrength
- Specific condition forums (Psych Central, CHADD for ADHD, etc.)
- Look for: Journey threads, "newly diagnosed" advice, long-term updates

**3. Personal Blogs & Substacks** (thoughtful, retrospective):
- Mental health journeys, chronic illness blogs
- Weight loss/fitness transformation blogs
- Career change narratives
- Look for: "What I learned" posts, timeline retrospectives

**4. YouTube Community Posts & Video Descriptions** (authentic storytelling):
- Recovery/wellness channels
- Health journey vloggers
- Look for: Progress updates, lessons learned sections

**5. AI Training Data Patterns** (what Claude has learned):
- Common narrative structures in health discussions
- Recurring themes in peer support
- Effective framing techniques
- Temporal progression patterns
- Look for: What patterns exist in your training about how people helpfully share health/wellness experiences

### What to Analyze

**NOT:** Individual posts to copy/paste
**YES:** Patterns across many sources:
- What structural elements appear repeatedly?
- What information types get thanked/valued?
- What narrative techniques create authenticity?
- What ingredients combine to make insight feel real?

---

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Pattern Discovery (Week 1-2)

**Objective:** Identify 8-12 emergent patterns across all sources

**Process:**
1. **Read broadly** (50-100 instances across sources)
2. **Tag structural elements** as you notice them:
   - Temporal markers ("Week 1 vs Month 6")
   - Emotional honesty ("I almost quit")
   - Specific details ("$47/week after insurance")
   - Warnings ("Don't make my mistake")
   - Reframes ("I thought X, realized Y")
   - Context ("Worked for me because Z")

3. **Group similar elements** into pattern categories
4. **Note frequency** (how often does each pattern appear?)
5. **Identify what makes it work** (why is this pattern helpful?)

### Phase 2: Ingredient Extraction (Week 2-3)

**Objective:** For each pattern, identify the **ingredients** that make it effective

**For each pattern, answer:**
- **What structural elements** must be present?
- **What emotional tone** works best?
- **What level of specificity** is needed?
- **What narrative arc** does it follow?
- **What makes it feel authentic** vs generic?

**Example (hypothetical "Timeline Reality" pattern):**
- ✅ Ingredients: Multiple time markers, honesty about rough patches, turning point moment, current state reflection
- ✅ Tone: Matter-of-fact with vulnerability
- ✅ Specificity: Actual week/month numbers, specific symptoms/changes
- ✅ Arc: Start → struggle → breakthrough → current reality
- ✅ Authenticity factors: Admits almost quitting, includes setbacks, avoids "and then everything was perfect"

### Phase 3: Frequency Ranking & Selection (Week 3)

**Objective:** Narrow to 3-5 highest-frequency, highest-value patterns

**Criteria for final selection:**
1. **Frequency:** Appears consistently across many sources
2. **Value:** Gets thanked, upvoted, referenced as helpful
3. **Universality:** Works across multiple goal types
4. **Generatability:** Can be synthetically created with ingredients

**Deliverable:** Final 3-5 patterns with full ingredient lists

---

## 🎯 Key Research Principles

### 1. Ingredients, Not Examples
- Don't collect posts to copy
- Extract the **what** and **how** that makes posts work
- Focus on structure, not specific stories

### 2. Pattern Frequency Matters
- We need data on which patterns appear most often
- "Appears in 80% of helpful posts" vs "Rare but powerful"
- Prioritize high-frequency patterns for final selection

### 3. Authenticity Ingredients Are Critical
**What makes commentary feel real?**
- Emotional honesty (struggles, setbacks, vulnerability)
- Specific details (exact costs, timelines, logistics)
- Temporal progression (how things changed over time)
- Contradictions/nuance (worked for me, might not for you)

These aren't separate patterns - they're ingredients that make ANY pattern authentic.

### 4. Variable Length by Pattern Type
- Some patterns work best short (50-100 words)
- Some need medium length (200-300 words)
- Some require depth (400-600 words)
- Document ideal length per pattern

### 5. Training Data as Source
**Leverage Claude's training:**
- What patterns exist in health/wellness discussions?
- What narrative structures appear in peer support?
- What framing techniques work across contexts?
- This is a PRIMARY source, not just supplemental

## 💡 Hypothesized Patterns (Validate/Refine/Replace)

These are starting points based on product intuition. Your research should **validate if these are actually high-frequency**, or **replace them with what you find**.

### Pattern 1: "Timeline Reality / What to Expect"
- **Hypothesis:** Shows temporal progression (week 1 vs month 6)
- **Potential ingredients:** Time markers, expectation vs reality, turning points, current state
- **Question:** How frequently does this pattern appear across sources?

### Pattern 2: "Things to Know Before Starting"
- **Hypothesis:** Pre-action guidance (cost reality, prerequisites, mindset prep)
- **Potential ingredients:** Surprises, hidden costs, what user wishes they'd known, barriers to anticipate
- **Question:** Is this universal or goal-specific?

### Pattern 3: "Mindset Shifts That Enabled Success"
- **Hypothesis:** Psychological reframes that made difference
- **Potential ingredients:** "I used to think... now I realize", cognitive shifts, belief changes
- **Question:** Does this pattern work across goal types or just some?

### Pattern 4: "Common Mistakes / What Didn't Work"
- **Hypothesis:** Preventable errors and lessons learned
- **Potential ingredients:** Failed approaches, course corrections, warnings, "don't do what I did"
- **Question:** How is this different from negative ratings? What's the added value?

### Pattern 5: "Combination Strategies / Context That Matters"
- **Hypothesis:** What works together, situational factors
- **Potential ingredients:** Synergies, "X + Y worked better than either alone", "worked for me because Z"
- **Question:** Is this about solutions or about user context?

**Your job:** Test if these 5 are high-frequency, or find the actual 3-5 most common patterns.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your research delivers value if it:

1. ✅ **Identifies 3-5 high-frequency patterns** with clear frequency data
2. ✅ **Provides complete ingredient lists** for each pattern (what makes it work)
3. ✅ **Includes generation templates** (how to synthetically create content)
4. ✅ **Documents authenticity factors** (real vs. generic examples)
5. ✅ **Leverages AI training data** as a primary source
6. ✅ **Enables synthetic content creation** without copying real posts

---

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### The Firewall Principle
**Research stage:** Study what makes posts helpful (ingredients, structure, patterns)
**↓ FIREWALL ↓**
**Generation stage:** Create new synthetic content using those ingredients

**Never:** Copy/paste real posts or closely paraphrase
**Always:** Extract patterns, then generate fresh content following those patterns

### Beyond Reddit
- Reddit is one source among many
- Health forums have deeper threads
- Blogs have retrospective insight
- AI training data has massive pattern recognition
- Hunt wherever people talk meaningfully about challenges

### Frequency Data Is Essential
- We need to know: "This pattern appears in 80% of sources" vs "Rare but valuable"
- Quantify how often each pattern appears
- Final selection based on frequency + value

### Authenticity Over Everything
The three ingredients that matter most:
1. **Emotional honesty** - struggles, setbacks, vulnerability
2. **Specific details** - exact costs, timelines, logistics
3. **Temporal progression** - how things changed over time

Every pattern should incorporate at least 2 of these 3.

### Questions You Might Have

**Q: Should I read AI training data or just web sources?**
A: Both! Training data is a PRIMARY source for identifying patterns. Use it extensively.

**Q: How do I avoid copying posts?**
A: Focus on structure, not stories. Extract "what makes this work" not "what this says."

**Q: What if frequency doesn't match value?**
A: Note both. If a rare pattern is exceptionally valuable, flag it. But prioritize high-frequency for initial selection.

**Q: How many sources should I analyze per pattern?**
A: Enough to see the pattern clearly - probably 20-30 instances minimum to validate frequency.

## Final Note

This research is foundational. The patterns you identify will shape thousands of pieces of qualitative content across 50+ goals. Your ingredient extraction will determine whether that content feels authentic or generic.

**The goal:** Enable users to see both sides of every solution:
- **Quantitative:** "4.5/5 effective, $150/session, 3-6 months"
- **Qualitative:** "Week 1 was brutal, week 6 was breakthrough, here's what nobody tells you..."

The second part doesn't exist yet. Your research makes it possible.
