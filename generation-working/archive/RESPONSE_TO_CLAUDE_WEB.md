# DO NOT use a generator script

**The whole point of this task is high-quality, evidence-based generation.**

A generator script will produce mechanistic data (equal distributions, formulaic patterns) - exactly what we're trying to avoid.

## What You Should Do

Generate all 45 solutions **manually** using the AI model's knowledge of:
- Research literature on anxiety treatments
- Clinical evidence for effectiveness
- Real-world usage patterns from studies
- Evidence-based distribution patterns

This means:
- ✅ Think through each solution individually
- ✅ Use research knowledge to determine realistic distributions
- ✅ Create varied, evidence-based percentages (not formulaic)
- ✅ Ensure 5-8 options per field with realistic variety

## What You Should NOT Do

- ❌ Write a script to generate distributions
- ❌ Use equal/mechanistic percentage splits
- ❌ Create formulaic patterns
- ❌ Automate the generation process

## The Task

You have **45 solutions to generate**. Yes, it's work. But that's exactly why you're doing this - to produce quality, evidence-based data that reflects actual research and clinical knowledge.

Save everything to:
`/home/user/wwfm-platform/generation-working/reduce-anxiety-45-solutions.json`

Follow the format in `JSON_OUTPUT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

Proceed with manual generation, not a script.
