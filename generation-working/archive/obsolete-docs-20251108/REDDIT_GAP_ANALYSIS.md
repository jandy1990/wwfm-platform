This is the **single biggest missed opportunity** for WWFM.

---

## 💡 Recommended Immediate Actions

### Phase 1: Validate (1-2 weeks)

1. **Deep-dive into r/relationship_advice**
   - Read top 100 posts from last month
   - Identify most common problem patterns
   - Note what solutions people recommend

2. **Survey caregiving communities**
   - Understand caregiver pain points
   - Identify solution gaps
   - Check if caregivers use crowdsourced advice

3. **Research parenting communities**
   - Map ADHD/autism parenting solution landscape
   - Check existing resources (are they adequate?)
   - Validate WWFM model fits parenting advice

### Phase 2: Pilot (2-4 weeks)

1. **Create 3 pilot goals** (one per Tier 1 category)
   - "Heal from breakup" (25 solutions)
   - "Care for parent with dementia" (25 solutions)
   - "Parent child with ADHD" (25 solutions)

2. **Seed with AI-generated solutions**
   - Use same quality standards as Top 35 expansion
   - Validate with community members

3. **Test with early users**
   - Recruit from Reddit communities (authentically)
   - Get feedback on solution quality
   - Check if model works for these problem types

### Phase 3: Scale (3-6 months)

1. **Build out Tier 1 categories** (20-26 goals, 775 solutions)
2. **Monitor engagement and contributions**
3. **Iterate based on user behavior**

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

### Relationship Advice Risks

**Risk:** People in crisis might follow bad advice
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize "what worked for me" not "you should do this"
- Include professional help solutions (therapy)
- Add disclaimers about abuse situations

### Caregiving Risks

**Risk:** Medical advice liability (dementia care is medical)
**Mitigation:**
- Focus on emotional support and practical logistics
- Don't allow medical treatment solutions
- Emphasize "complement to professional care"

### Parenting Risks

**Risk:** Judgmental "mom-shaming" culture
**Mitigation:**
- Strong community moderation
- Emphasize "different things work for different kids"
- Include professional (therapist, OT) solutions

### LGBTQ+ Risks

**Risk:** Conversion therapy or harmful "solutions"
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-screen solutions aggressively
- Partner with LGBTQ+ organizations for validation
- Ban any non-affirming content

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis with team**
2. **Decide on Tier 1 vs. continuing Top 35 expansion**
3. **If pursuing gaps:**
   - Start with Phase 1 validation (1-2 weeks)
   - Create pilot goals (2-4 weeks)
   - Measure engagement before full buildout

**Critical Question:** Should we finish Top 35 expansion (423 solutions, 6-9 weeks) BEFORE tackling these gaps? Or pivot now to capture massive relationship/caregiving audiences?
