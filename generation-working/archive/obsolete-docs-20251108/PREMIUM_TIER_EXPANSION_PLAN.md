---

## 🎯 Goal Selection Criteria by Phase

### Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
**Target:** <5 solution gap per goal
- Already strong baseline (30-49 solutions)
- Well-defined category boundaries
- Abundant solution options available
- Can batch 2-3 goals per session

### Phase 2 (Medium Builds)

- Moderate research required
- 1 goal per session

### Phase 3 (Major Builds)
**Target:** 19-23 solution gap per goal
- Broadest solution diversity needed
- 6-8 categories to cover
- Significant research + generation work
- 1 goal per 1-2 sessions

---

## 📊 Resource Requirements

### Total Effort Estimate
- **Phase 1:** 1-2 sessions (15 solutions, 4 goals)
- **Phase 2:** 3-4 sessions (40 solutions, 3 goals)
- **Phase 3:** 5-7 sessions (60 solutions, 3 goals)

**Total:** 9-13 sessions for complete Premium Tier coverage

### Per-Session Breakdown (Typical)

- **Medium gap (10-15 solutions):** 1.5-2 hours
- **Large gap (19-23 solutions):** 2-3 hours (split into 2-3 batches)

### Quality Standards (Maintained)
- 5-8 option distributions per field
- Research/studies sources only
- Evidence-based percentages
- Category-appropriate fields per SSOT
- Deduplication against all existing solutions

---

## 🔍 Solution Generation Strategy

### Category Diversity Targets

**For 45-50 solution goals (Tier 1A):**
Target representation across 10-12 categories:
1. medications (if applicable)
2. therapists_counselors
3. apps_software
4. books_courses
5. habits_routines
6. exercise_movement
7. meditation_mindfulness
8. supplements_vitamins
9. natural_remedies
10. products_devices
11. diet_nutrition
12. support_groups

**For 35-40 solution goals (Tier 1B):**
Target representation across 7-9 categories:
- Focus on most applicable/effective categories for that goal
- Avoid forcing categories that don't fit naturally

### Solution Mix Philosophy

**Low-Barrier (30%):** Free or <$20/month
- Apps with free tiers
- Library books, YouTube courses
- Self-directed habits/routines
- Generic supplements

**Medium-Barrier (50%):** $20-200/month
- Paid apps/subscriptions
- Specific supplements/products
- Group therapy/coaching
- Structured programs

**High-Barrier (20%):** $200+/month or high commitment
- Individual therapy
- Medical procedures
- Prescription medications
- Intensive programs

## 📈 Success Metrics & Validation

### Immediate Metrics (Per Goal Completion)
- ✅ Target solution count achieved (45-50 or 35-40)
- ✅ Database validation passes
- ✅ All distributions have 5-8 options
- ✅ Category diversity target met

### Post-Launch Metrics (3-6 months)
- **Traffic share:** Do Top 10 goals drive 70%+ of organic traffic?
- **Conversion rate:** Do 45-50 solution goals convert better than 20-30?
- **Bounce rate:** Does comprehensive coverage reduce bounce?
- **Scroll depth:** Do users engage with more solutions?

### ROI Calculation
**Investment:** ~115 solutions × 10min/solution = ~19 hours of generation work

**Expected Return:**
- If Top 10 drive 100K monthly visitors (conservative)
- 5% conversion to contributors = 5K new ratings/month
- Network effects = platform credibility boost
- SEO compound growth from content depth

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Diminishing Solution Quality
**Mitigation:**
- Strict 5-8 option distribution requirement
- Skip solutions if can't meet quality bar
- Better 42 quality solutions than 50 mediocre ones

### Risk 2: Category Forcing
**Mitigation:**
- Use traffic analysis + research to validate categories
- "Quit smoking" doesn't need "hobbies_activities"
- Stay authentic to what actually works

### Risk 3: Maintenance Burden
**Mitigation:**
- AI-generated = less maintenance than user-generated
- Data is static (distributions don't change often)
- Can deprecate low-performing solutions later

### Risk 4: Scope Creep
**Mitigation:**
- Hard stop after Wave 7 (Top 10 complete)
- Reassess strategy before expanding further
- User data should drive next priorities, not completion

```

## 🎯 Alignment with Original Mission

**Original Goal:** Fill gaps for 24 low-coverage goals (~220 solutions)

**New Strategy:** Premium Tier focus for top 10 traffic goals (+115 solutions)

**Why the pivot:**
- **Traffic-driven:** These 10 goals will drive majority of users
- **Quality over quantity:** Better to excel at top problems than be mediocre everywhere
- **Resource efficiency:** 115 solutions across 10 goals > 220 across 24 goals
- **User experience:** Depth beats breadth for high-intent searches

**What happens to original 24 goals?**
- 3 already complete (Wave 1)
- 7 covered in Top 10 (anxiety, stress, focus, smoking, debt, weight, acne)
- Remaining 14 goals become Wave 8+ (optional, data-driven decision)
