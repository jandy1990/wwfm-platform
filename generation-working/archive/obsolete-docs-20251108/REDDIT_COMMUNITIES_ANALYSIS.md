1. **Subscribe and lurk** in Top 10 relevant subreddits
2. **Document patterns** in solution discussions (what works, what doesn't)
3. **Identify gaps** in current WWFM solution coverage
4. **Validate field distributions** (do real users report same side effects, costs, time to results?)

### Phase 2: Authentic Participation (Medium Risk)
1. **Participate genuinely** in discussions (no WWFM mentions yet)
2. **Build credibility** as helpful community member (1-2 months)
3. **Identify opportunities** where WWFM genuinely adds value
4. **Get mod approval** if planning any outreach

### Phase 3: Strategic Outreach (Higher Risk, Higher Reward)
