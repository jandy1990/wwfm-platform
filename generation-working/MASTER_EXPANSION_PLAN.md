## 🎯 Strategic Rationale

### Why This Order?

**Phases 1-3 First (Top 35):**
- Proven goal types (lower risk)
- Clear traffic validation
- Established execution pattern
- 16-21 weeks to complete

**Phases 4-6 Second (New Categories):**
- Validate new categories work
- Can pivot if engagement is low
- Build on momentum from Top 35
- 12-15 weeks to complete

**Phase 7 Integrated:**
- Existing goals already validated
- Mixed into Phases 2-3 for efficiency

### Success Metrics

**Per Goal:**
- ✅ Target solution count achieved
- ✅ 7-12 categories represented
- ✅ 4-5 options per field distribution
- ✅ Zero empty fields
- ✅ Frontend displays correctly

**Overall Campaign:**
- ✅ All goals at 35-45 solutions (premium coverage)
- ✅ Total platform solutions: 1,227+ (current 449 + 778 new)
- ✅ Average 40+ solutions per goal
- ✅ New categories validated with user engagement

---

## 💡 Quality Standards (Maintained Across All Phases)

**Every solution MUST have:**
- ✅ 4-5 option distributions per field (evidence-based percentages)
- ✅ Research/studies sources only (no fallback sources)
- ✅ Category-appropriate fields per SSOT (`docs/solution-fields-ssot.md`)
- ✅ Proper variants for medications/supplements (3-5 dosages each)
- ✅ Deduplication against ALL existing solutions

**New Category Validation:**
- ✅ Goal must be specific and measurable (not "navigate divorce")
- ✅ Solutions must be rateable (not emotional/philosophical)
- ✅ Outcomes must be trackable (pain reduction, sleep hours, meltdown frequency)
- ✅ Follows WWFM goal criteria (Tier 1-2, not Tier 4)

---

## 📁 Implementation Workflow (Same for All Phases)

### Per-Goal Checklist

**Before Generation:**
1. ✅ Query current solution count and category distribution (for existing goals)
2. ✅ Research goal-specific solutions (medical literature, Reddit communities, market analysis)
3. ✅ Check SSOT for category field requirements
4. ✅ Review existing solutions to avoid duplication (if expanding)
5. ✅ Identify underrepresented categories

**During Generation:**
1. ✅ Generate 8-12 solutions per batch (manageable chunks)
2. ✅ Ensure category diversity (no more than 3 per category unless heavily weighted)
3. ✅ Create realistic field distributions (4-5 options minimum)
4. ✅ Include proper variants for dosage categories
5. ✅ Write to `final-output.json`

**After Generation:**
1. ✅ Run `insert-solutions-with-dedup.ts`
2. ✅ Verify database insertion (solution count increased)
3. ✅ Check data quality (no empty fields, no zero ratings)
4. ✅ Test frontend display (distributions show correctly)
5. ✅ Archive to `generation-working/archive/phase-X-goal-name/`
6. ✅ Update todo list

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1, Goal 1)

**Goal:** Overcome insomnia
**Current:** 34 solutions
**Target:** 35 solutions
**Need:** +1 solution
**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Suggested solution:** Sleep restriction therapy (habits_routines)

**Execution:**
1. Read `HANDOVER.md` for quality standards
2. Generate 1 solution in `final-output.json`
3. Run insertion script
4. Verify count: 34 → 35
5. Mark Phase 1, Goal 1 complete
6. Move to next goal (Manage chronic fatigue, +3 solutions)

---

## 📊 New Goals: Database Creation Checklist

For Phases 4-6 (new goals not in database), use this process:

### Step 1: Create Goal in Database

```sql
-- Example for parenting goal
INSERT INTO goals (title, description, arena_id, is_active)
VALUES (
  'Manage autism meltdowns',
  'Reduce frequency and intensity of autism meltdowns through evidence-based interventions',
  (SELECT id FROM arenas WHERE name = 'Family & Relationships'),
  true
)
RETURNING id;
```

### Step 2: Verify Arena Mapping

New goals likely belong to:
- **Parenting goals** → "Family & Relationships" arena
- **Women's health goals** → "Physical Health" arena
- **Caregiving goals** → "Family & Relationships" arena

### Step 3: Generate Solutions (Same Process)

Once goal exists, follow standard workflow:
1. Generate solutions in batches of 10-12
2. Use `insert-solutions-with-dedup.ts`
3. Verify data quality
4. Archive completed work

---

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### New Category Risks

**Parenting Goals:**
- **Risk:** Judgmental "mom-shaming" culture
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize "different things work for different kids," strong moderation

**Women's Health Goals:**
- **Risk:** Medical advice liability
- **Mitigation:** Include "consult doctor" disclaimers, focus on peer experiences not medical guidance

**Caregiving Goals:**
- **Risk:** Medical advice for dementia patients
- **Mitigation:** Focus on caregiver support and practical logistics, not medical treatment

### Quality Assurance

**After each new category (Phases 4-6):**
1. Monitor user engagement for 2-4 weeks
2. Check if people rate solutions (rateable outcomes)
3. Verify solution quality meets standards
4. Adjust approach if needed before scaling
