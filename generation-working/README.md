## 💡 What Makes Goals Work for WWFM?

**From** `docs/decisions/goal-curation-2025.md`:

✅ **GOOD (Tier 1-2):** Specific, measurable, rateable solutions
- "Manage autism meltdowns" (specific behavior, measurable outcome)
- "Manage endometriosis pain" (specific condition, measurable symptom)
- "Get special needs child to sleep" (specific problem, trackable outcome)

❌ **BAD (Tier 4):** Philosophical, subjective, emotional journeys
- "Heal from breakup" (too fuzzy, emotional healing is subjective)
- "Find my purpose" (philosophical, no clear endpoint)
- "Navigate divorce" (too broad, emotional journey)

**Rule:** Goals must have concrete, rateable solutions that users can validate as "worked" or "didn't work"
