# MLA Gulfood Innovation Challenge - International Contact Research

## Project Context

You are helping research organizations to promote the **MLA Gulfood Innovation Challenge 2026**, a competition run by Meat & Livestock Australia (MLA) for innovations in the red meat industry. The challenge will culminate in a pitch event at Gulfood Dubai (January 26-30, 2026) where 5 selected teams will present solutions to industry leaders.

## The Three Innovation Challenges

**Challenge A: Sustainable Packaging**
- Problem: PVDC resin (current standard for meat packaging) is now classified as problematic plastic
- Need: Bio-polymers or novel barrier materials that match/exceed current shelf life (90+ days for lamb, 120+ days for beef) while meeting recycling requirements
- Relevant orgs: Sustainable packaging companies, materials science research groups, circular economy organizations

**Challenge B: Ambient Storage for Red Meat**
- Problem: Raw red meat requires expensive, emission-intensive cold chain. Current ambient alternatives (freeze-dried) have poor taste/texture
- Need: Technologies enabling shelf-stable raw meat with maintained taste, texture, and food safety (water activity <0.6)
- Relevant orgs: Food preservation tech companies, novel processing technology groups, food science research centers

**Challenge C: Nutrient-Dense Wellness Meat Products**
- Problem: Rising global obesity alongside malnutrition. Red meat is underutilized despite being nutrient-dense
- Need: Products leveraging red meat as nutrient-rich ingredient in novel formats, targeting specific health claims (iron, B12, protein, zinc)
- Relevant orgs: Functional foods companies, nutrition research groups, alternative protein innovators, biotech companies

## Your Task

We have already researched **65 Australian organizations**. Now expand the search **internationally** to find **35-85 additional high-quality organizations** (target total: 100-150 organizations).

## File Locations

**Input file** (read this first to understand format):
`/Users/jackandrews/Desktop/wwfm-platform/MLA Research/DRAFT_Outreach Table - mla-contacts-complete.csv`

**Output file** (create this):
`/Users/jackandrews/Desktop/wwfm-platform/MLA Research/mla-contacts-international.csv`

## Geographic Priorities

**Priority 1** (English-speaking, culturally similar to Australia):
- USA
- Canada
- UK
- Ireland
- New Zealand

**Priority 2** (Major innovation hubs):
- Netherlands
- Germany
- Singapore
- Switzerland
- Nordics (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland)

**Priority 3** (Relevant but may have language/culture gaps):
- France
- Spain
- Israel
- Japan
- South Korea
- UAE (given Dubai event)

**Include other countries if organizations are highly relevant to the challenges**

## Organization Types to Find

Same categories as Australian research:

1. **Accelerators & Incubators**
   - FoodTech accelerators
   - AgTech accelerators
   - Biotech incubators
   - Climate tech/CleanTech programs
   - Government innovation programs

2. **Universities**
   - Food science departments
   - Materials science/packaging programs
   - Biotechnology programs
   - Commercialization/tech transfer offices
   - Research institutes focused on food innovation

3. **Industry Associations**
   - Food science professional bodies
   - Packaging industry associations
   - Biotechnology associations
   - Meat industry groups
   - Circular economy networks

4. **Companies**
   - Sustainable packaging companies
   - Food preservation technology companies
   - Cultivated/alternative protein companies
   - Functional foods/nutraceutical companies
   - Major meat processors with innovation programs

## Contact Quality Standards

For each organization, find the BEST contact in this priority order:

1. **Named Individual with Direct Email** (BEST)
   - Format: "Name - Title (email@domain.com)"

2. **Named Individual with LinkedIn**
   - Format: "Name - Title (LinkedIn: url)"

3. **Department Email**
   - Format: "Department Name (email@domain.com)"

4. **Direct Contact Form URL**
   - Must be actual form URL, not homepage
   - Format: "Contact Form: [exact URL]"

5. **General Contact Email** (LAST RESORT)
   - Format: "General Inquiries (info@organization.com)"

## Search Strategy

For each organization:
1. Search: "[Org name] innovation partnerships contact"
2. Search: "[Org name] business development"
3. Check website → Team/About/Contact pages
4. Check LinkedIn → People tab
5. Look for: Program Directors, Innovation Managers, Business Development, Partnership leads

**Focus on QUALITY over QUANTITY** - only include organizations with:
- Clear relevance to at least one challenge
- Findable contact information
- Active programs/operations (not defunct)

## CSV Format

Read the existing Australian CSV to understand the exact format, then replicate it exactly. Expected columns:
- Name
- Type
- Justification (brief explanation of relevance)
- Best Contact
- Location/Country (add this for international file)

## Work Process

1. **Read the Australian CSV** to understand format and quality bar
2. **Research in batches of 10-15 organizations**
3. **Save progress after each batch** to the international CSV
4. **Track progress** in a separate file: `international-research-progress.md`

## Examples of International Organizations to Consider

**USA Examples:**
- Y Combinator (FoodTech track)
- Plug and Play Food & Beverage
- MIT Media Lab (food innovation)
- Cornell Food Science Department
- Good Food Institute
- PSSI (global food safety/innovation)

**Europe Examples:**
- EIT Food (pan-European food innovation)
- Foodvalley NL (Netherlands)
- Future Food Institute (Italy)
- Wageningen University (Netherlands)
- Nordic Food Lab (Denmark)
- Imperial College London (food science)

**Asia Examples:**
- SGInnovate (Singapore)
- A*STAR (Singapore food research)
- Shiok Meats, Eat Just (Singapore cultivated protein)
- CPI Korea (food packaging)

**DO NOT just copy these - research thoroughly and find the best contact for each**

## Deliverables

1. **`mla-contacts-international.csv`** - Final table with 35-85 organizations in identical format to Australian file
2. **`international-research-progress.md`** - Track batches completed and any difficulties
3. **`research-notes.md`** - Note any organizations where contact info couldn't be found or quality concerns

## Quality Checks Before Adding Organization

- ✅ Clearly relevant to Challenge A, B, or C?
- ✅ Active and operational (check recent news/posts)?
- ✅ Found quality contact information (not just generic "info@")?
- ✅ Would they realistically be interested in this challenge?

Start with North American accelerators and universities, then move to Europe, then Asia. Prioritize quality and relevance over hitting exact numbers.
