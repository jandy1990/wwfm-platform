# WWFM Goal Database Cleanup Summary
*Date: September 3-4, 2025*

## Executive Summary

**Massive database streamlining completed:** Reduced from **781 original goals** to **271 focused goals** (65% reduction) to create a cleaner, more effective platform focused on actionable, rateable solutions.

### Key Numbers
- **Original Goals:** 781
- **Goals Removed:** 510 (65.2%)
- **Goals Remaining:** 271 (34.8%)
- **Categories Affected:** 84 total categories reviewed
- **Completely Removed Categories:** 28 categories (100% removal)

## Removal Strategy

Goals were removed based on these criteria:
1. **Too Abstract/Philosophical** - Goals like "Find my purpose" or "Feel fulfilled"
2. **Too Personal/Situational** - Family dynamics, relationship issues, parenting
3. **Too Medical/Clinical** - Conditions requiring professional treatment
4. **Too Broad/Vague** - Generic goals without specific measurable outcomes
5. **Too Niche/Specialized** - Highly specific contexts (HOA rules, workplace politics)

**Result:** All remaining goals work well with WWFM's solution-rating model where users can meaningfully rate specific solutions with stars.

- **Community discussion topics** - Forum discussions rather than solution ratings  
- **Inspiration for new specific goals** - Break abstract goals into concrete sub-goals
- **Reference material** - Understanding user interests for future platform development

## Summary

This cleanup transformed WWFM from a broad life-improvement platform into a **focused solution-rating system** where users can find and share specific, actionable approaches to concrete problems. Every remaining goal works perfectly with the star-rating model, creating a cleaner, more effective user experience.

**The result: A platform where users can confidently rate solutions like "Headspace meditation app: ★★★★☆ for anxiety" rather than struggling to rate approaches to abstract concepts like "finding purpose."**
