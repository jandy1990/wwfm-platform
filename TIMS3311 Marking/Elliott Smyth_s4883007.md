**TIMS3311 Assessment 2 Reflection – Elliott Smyth**

**Critical Reflection Essay**

<u>Introduction</u>

For my WIL Placement, I applied to join the Brisbane start-up Eclipse
Ingredients located in QUT. After seeing Siobhan Coster’s (CEO) pitch at
the start of the semester, the topic and goals behind the business
inspired me to think further into the possibilities with Lactoferrin.
Upon joining, the student team for food and beverage products was me and
Jess Callaghan, who was also quite passionate about the subject. We
engaged in weekly zoom call check-ins with Siobhan, providing us with
advice and direction to focus our efforts. This mainly consisted of
customer interviews and thorough market research to identify the most
desirable food or beverage product to address a customer’s needs. My
personal entrepreneurial focus during this investigation has been to
improve my teamwork skills, leadership skills, and primarily my
communication skills (which I lacked significantly prior). This
reflection will discuss elements of Design Thinking as well as the Lean
Start-up approach.

<u>Overall WIL Experience</u>

<u>Personal Lessons</u>

The most memorable positive moment during this placement was when we
were invited to visit Eclipse’s lab and headquarters in QUT. We were
able to meet everyone involved in the real life process and witness the
fermentation process live, which was very inspiring. This moment was
significant to me because it gave a whole lot more depth and weight to
the work that I was putting in. As opposed to theoretical case studies,
this made me feel like my time spent working with Eclipse was worth it
and actually making a difference. It definitely motivated me to keep
working hard on this project with Jess. The biggest challenge for me was
actually organizing and conducting customer interviews, since I am not
as confident with my public speaking skills. The first couple of
interviews were hard to conduct because I wasn’t comfortable speaking
with people in this context, but it opened a very important learning
opportunity to improve. For this, I am very appreciative of the
challenge. The main thing I learnt from this was that every negative
thought and bad scenario that crossed my mind leading up the interview
would instantly disappear when I acted. Next time I would apply this
mentality to every challenge that I’m faced with and “go” as soon
possible, as opposed to waiting for the perfect moment.

<u>Networks Established</u>

Upon joining the team, the first person I met was my teammate, Jess
Callaghan. He was selected as team captain and has performed very
effectively. We both established clear communication at the beginning
regarding any issues, wins, losses or general information relevant to
the task. From being in a team with Jess, I learnt that even though he
was the team captain, the responsibility is shared among us because we
need to work effectively. Siobhan was the other main connection that was
incredibly valued during this investigation. She provided guidance and
feedback that helped me refine my decision-making skills and confidence.

<u>New Knowledge, Insights and Skills</u>

<u>The Past</u>

My original perception of entrepreneurial thinking and process was very
limited with an understanding of the theoretical side. I understood the
‘build-measure-learn’ loop (Ries, 2011) but hadn’t applied it under real
constraints. I encountered the real-life methodology as challenging to
follow close without getting sidetracked. An example of this was when
saying the steps that we as a team were going to follow, I had a very
limited idea of how we were actually going to execute the plan. When
entering this challenge, I was concerned about the implications that
would test my comfort zone to achieve the next goal.

<u>Key Learnings</u>

The Design Thinking approach was evident throughout the investigation.
The empathy stage completely shifted how I approached user interviews,
instead of focusing on solutions for customers, I started listening for
pain points (Interaction Design Foundation, 2016). This change allowed
me to eliminate potential bias in my process and understand their
perspective directly. This is a common issue that most people face when
in a start-up scenario. People will get blinded by the potential
usefulness of their product and will ignore or filter out other issues
that their product does not fulfill. When I applied this framework into
the project, I noticed that I was capturing a lot more detail from
interviewees and seeing a more growth mindset being revealed on my
behalf. It was a worthy investment to implement the design thinking
approach into capturing customer needs and pain points.

The Lean Start-up model helped our team through the design and
appearance of our MVP. We designed posters that described two different
styles of product that had similar functionalities for two different
demographics. One had iron-boosting qualities and was featured in a
powdered format to suit a supplement product style. The other was
tailored towards gym goers with a performance-style beverage that
supported muscle recovery post-workout. Having these Lean Start-up MVP
designs helped us colorize what we had understood to be the main needs
of the customer base. A major step forward in progress.

The empathy phase of Design Thinking helped me define the right problem,
while Lean Start-up guided how I tested early solutions. This
combination kept me grounded in available means and resources,
reinforcing that innovation isn’t about grand vision but about small,
adaptive steps forward.

<u>The Future</u>

From experiencing what it’s like to work in a research-based start-up
role, I’ve learnt a new mindset of tackling unknown issues. These skills
I have acquired will carry through into my career and will help satisfy
my entrepreneurial goals in future. The placement clarified that I want
to pursue roles that combine creativity with analytical thinking,
potentially such as product management or innovation consulting. Working
in a start-up can be stressful as the risks of failing are high and
frequent, but I also recognize that the amount of learning opportunities
that arise are most worth it. One of the main skills that an
entrepreneur learns is adaptability which is paramount to surviving in a
hostile and competitive environment such as the food and tech industry.

<u>Course Feedback</u>

The WIL placement work is, in my opinion, incredibly important to
experience for a business student. Since majority of the course work
with other courses is theoretical regarding case studies, having a
real-life “practical” project will teach students so much more. The
skills that are acquired in this context aren’t specifically taught in
the classroom but are developed over time by being in the real-world
competitive space. I valued the practical exposure and real feedback.
Potential suggestions for improvement of the course would be to offer
earlier networking sessions, clearer framework templates, and peer
reflection workshops.

<u>Conclusion</u>

This WIL placement experience with Eclipse has been a transformative
period of both personal and professional development. It challenged me
to move beyond theoretical understanding and engage directly with the
uncertainty and creativity that define entrepreneurship. Through
utilizing the Design Thinking approach and the Lean Start-up framework,
I learned to listen more deeply, test assumptions earlier, and make
informed decisions grounded in empathy and evidence. These methodologies
helped me improve my technical and communication skills, as well as my
approach to seeking to solve problems. Understanding that continuous
improvement is more realistic than immediate perfection.

Working alongside Siobhan and Jess reinforced the significance of
collaboration, constructive feedback, and adaptability within a start-up
environment. Ultimately, this placement improved my confidence and
confirmed my interest in pursuing a career that blends innovation,
strategy, and creative problem solving.

**Diary Entries**

<u>Diary Record 1:</u>

The first main challenge when working with Eclipse Ingredients is
understanding their product and system. This process of adapting and
learning took place over the first several weeks with multiple-group
check-ins. Originally, I assumed that understanding Eclipse’s product
would involve general desktop research. This assumption was proven
incorrect since communicating with Siobhan has allowed me to fully
understand their vision and goals with implementing their Lactoferrin
product. When placed in a new working environment such as this, it takes
time to immerse yourself in the organization’s process and
understanding. The weekly zoom-call check-ins with Siobhan were pivotal
for guidance and advice toward our project goals. She was able to
provide that initial foundation of knowledge that pushed us to pursue
certain customer segments. This key insight would best correlate with
the Lean Start-up approach since it builds that first foundation of
knowledge to action on customer segment validation. A perfect gateway
into the investigation.

<u>Diary Record 2:</u>

A learning opportunity that arose was when the initial presentation
(Assessment 1) was due. Personally, I am not the most comfortable public
speaker so when this task was approaching, I was feeling rather worried.
The presentation went decently well, of which I spoke about the
introduction, executive summary, WIL context & landscape, and problem
deep dive and my partner discussed the methodology & approach, expected
deliverables & outcomes, resources & implementation. The aspect that
made me the most nervous was trying to convey the dialogue to the
audience in the most clear and concise manner. I believe I executed this
somewhat effectively. Another point of concern was promising what was to
be done and then actioning on it later down the track. However, having
that reminder on the side kept our group aligned with our goals and held
us accountable for any progress loss. This part of the investigation
links to the Design Thinking approach where we framed a question,
gathered inspiration, and synthesized for action for the later weeks.

<u>Diary Record 3:</u>

The biggest learning component for me personally was applying the
communications aspect from the Lean Start-up approach mindset. This is
mainly used to validate customer beliefs and to further understand the
necessary steps to align our value proposition with their needs and
wants. Throughout this investigation, customer interviews and feedback
have been the main event for progress. In a general sense, engaging in
these customer interviews taught me a lot more about using Zoom and
organizing calls/meetings. It also helped encourage me to break the ice
with new people to find out what data can be extracted. Through this, it
improved my confidence skills in a communications aspect. This step is
core to the success of the investigation since desktop research and
assumptions can only go so far. Real-life interactions and opinions are
what have helped mold our ideas into being closer to reality. The
insights that I collected through these interviews were valuable to the
investigation, the interviews helped eliminate certain customer segments
and open up new ones. For example, at one point our group assumed that
an older female demographic would benefit most from Lactoferrin’s
properties. However, we soon learnt through multiple interviews that an
older demographic audience is more skeptical of technologically
innovative foods. So, from that, we knew we needed to target a younger
age group.

<u>Diary Record 4:</u>

A pivotal moment during this project was when Siobhan corrected my
approach to creating ideas for the task. I originally approached this
idea with pre-made assumptions, thinking that I knew everything by
myself. That is where the interviews came in and steered my trajectory.
I was under the impression that we needed to make a product that people
wanted, but Siobhan’s advice made me realise that we need to search for
common problems that people have that Lactoferrin can aid in solving.
This switch of mindset allowed me to process feedback and data in a much
more streamlined way. This moment helped me in understanding the mind of
the perfect consumer for this product, especially when designing posters
for the MVP. Our group of two designed two separate posters that catered
towards the different customer segments. One design had muscle recovery
and performance as its main theme where the other one emulated
iron-boosting and immune health. This part of the MVP helped identify
what customers are looking for in the perfect supplement product.

<u>Diary Record 5:</u>

My final insight into this segment would be to highlight how my skills
and abilities have evolved since doing this course. Working with a
real-world start-up has given me greater perspective on how significant
business frameworks are. This learning journey has not been all highs,
there have been struggles where our team has had to make choices that we
were not comfortable with, but that is where the growth has occurred. My
confidence has been challenged by feedback on areas where I need to
improve but I understand the importance of it in future. A clear example
of this was when I initially thought I was doing enough customer
interviews, but Siobhan pointed out that my assumptions were based on a
small group of individuals, therefore meaning my interviews were
insufficient in size. This scenario held me accountable and pushed me to
attain a higher number of interviews, which in the end helped us
progress through the project. So, the main takeaway from this diary
entry is to say that I have improved in taking constructive criticism
and actioning on it to achieve the goal in mind.
