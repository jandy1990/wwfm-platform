Personal Lessons
​      Throughout this work-integrated learning process, I have learnt and refined many skills
that will be useful for my future career. A main one that came vitally from the WIL interview
process is persistence mixed with a healthy amount of confidence. Interviewing people in an
industry as introverted as the pharmaceutical industry required a lot of persistence and
confidence, as without it, people would be unwilling to talk to us. From a more business-oriented
perspective, I not only learnt how to apply a lean startup model, design thinking, and
effectuation, but I also learnt many stakeholder communication and market analysis skills. Being
put into a startup company that I knew nothing about and an industry that I am unfamiliar with
required me to be adaptable and to push myself to become familiar, in particular with an MVP
that I had not created and was not overly comfortable with. The lean startup methodology of
build-measure-learn ironically helped me learn more about the MVP, as I walked through it with
people who were more familiar with the terminology on the software, it became more familiar to
me.
​      The major challenge of the process was the reluctance of industry personnel to speak to
us, but it also became one of the highlights. Pillflow wanted us to focus on pharmacists in our
interviews, which led us to email every pharmacy in the greater Brisbane area, with not one
response. This pushed up to be more innovative, talking to people who aren’t directly in the
industry, and one of the biggest highlights was when we would make unexpected breakthroughs
with random people. For instance, when we found out what the Pharmaceutical Guild of
Australia was. Overall, if we were to do this process again, I would reach out to more people
who are indirectly linked to the industry, as they are more open to speaking about the flaws and
have a larger, often more niche, perspective on the industry.


Networks Created
       Unfortunately, due to the student team being only two of us, I did not make any new
connections within it. However, beyond that, I feel that I made a great new connection with the
startup team of Alfred and Viknesh, and if we don’t continue to work together, I will definitely
be invested in the success going forward. Outside of that, the interview process allowed me to
create networks with strangers, with a specific example being two pharmacists at a local
Chempro. Though the connection is not deep yet, the conversations that we had about topics they
were passionate about opened a channel of friendship and further connection. When I go in there
on occasion, we talk more about this course, and further challenges they are facing, and will
continue to do so, which will continue to help me develop skills such as confidence and
stakeholder communication. Overall, I really enjoyed the process and the connections I created
throughout it.


Past Knowledge
       Being in the process of a dual degree in business management and design, I am quite
familiar with the base theories and skills needed to launch a startup. I have come across the main
theories of lean startup, effectuation, and design thinking, and have applied the theories to
different courses, such as in design infrastructure. In the course, we had direct communication to
are target audience, being aged, care residents. During the process, we tested theories with MVPs
and codesign to develop a functional and effective product as part of the lean-startup
methodology. While I had a decent baseline knowledge of theories and applications, I still had a
long way to go to be effective in the innovation and entrepreneurship space. In particular, I had
not put effectuation into practice.


Current Knowledge
​      An important entrepreneurial concept that I put into practice through the WIL process is
the lean startup methodology. Throughout the semester, we tested many assumptions, with our
biggest confirmed one being the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry, which required us as
managers to be flexible and adaptable. The industry's reluctance to communicate and change
made me question whether Pillflow should pivot or preserve its initial choice of targeting
pharmacies as its pilot programs. However, with further discussions with the guys at Pillflow,
they justified their choices. The importance of an MVP really stood out throughout the WIL
process, as it allows me, as an entrepreneur, to waste less time being stuck in a design slump and
hyperfocusing on unimportant factors of my startup. Constantly having communication with the
target audience allows entrepreneurs to develop the most effective product possible and reduce
wasted resources.
​      Though I have come across them before in my previous courses, it was beneficial to put
design thinking and empathy mapping into practice in the real world. Mapping out the target
audience's feelings, thoughts, and pain points helps put into context the current industry's flaws,
and combining that with a SWOT diagram exposes the next steps that the startup should take,
depending on its opportunities and threats. Understanding, through empathy mapping, workflow
frustrations in the current industry, such as slow updates, error-prone, and time-consuming, helps
reinforce the importance of the Pillflow service.
​      Unfortunately, due to the deliverables expected from Pillflow, we did not put into practice
the effectuation methodology ourselves; however, the theories of affordable loss and starting
with your means were observable in the way the entrepreneurs at Pillflow acted. Viknesh used
his current means, a career at Terry White, to launch their first pilot program, which developed
their idea from there. They put effort into expanding their means by participating and winning a
Shark Tank equivalent convention, which shows commitment and innovation. Though I
would’ve been interested in putting the effectuation methodology into practice myself, it was
insightful to see how two committed startup entrepreneurs put it into practice.
​      Moving past the main theories taught within the course, another skill that I learned
throughout the WIL process is the development of a value proposition through stakeholder
communication and interviews. Value proposition, as a concept, has always been one of the more
confusing ones on the business model canvas, but this WIL process taught me how to effectively
create value. Listening directly to the target audience and stakeholders allows you to quickly
develop the essential features of your service or product, instead of just guessing what would be
desired. Going straight to the target audience is what I will be doing in the future in all my
startup contributions, as it will give me an easy understanding and an effective starting base.
​      Overall, the work is an integrated learning process that has taught me a lot of useful skills
in practice and theory, which I will use in the future to help my and others' startups succeed.


Future Knowledge
​      Now that I reflect on my time within the WIL process, I believe that the skills and
knowledge I have gained throughout the semester will positively affect my future career, whether
that is as a self-employed entrepreneur or working for a company. While I don’t understand the
scale of impact as of yet, I believe my understanding of the startup process has given me a
competitive career advantage. I feel more confident and less overwhelmed in my ability to create
my own startup if I feel that I have a valuable idea. Viewing committed startup entrepreneurs in
action has inspired me to take a similar path and taught me positive steps I can take on my way
to my goals. I believe that having a confident and proven grasp of concepts like lean startup,
design thinking, effectuation, and value creation will positively impact my chances in the job
market and may even shape my future as an entrepreneur.
​
​
Course Feedback
​      As stated in the previous sections, I believe the skills that I have learned in this class will
positively impact my path in my future career, which I value a lot in this course. I also value the
real-world experience that I can take into my future courses and career.
​      If I were to make improvement to this course, for starters, I understand the point of
minimal structure in regards to the work-integrated learning process. It occasionally felt like we
were a burden on the startup because they felt like they needed to make up tasks for us to do. For
future runs of the course, it might be necessary to ensure the startups have a vetted task list so
that it doesn’t make them feel pressure to work around us. Secondly, while the real-world
experience is irreplaceable, it sometimes felt like my success in the course was determined by
outside factors such as startup commitment and stakeholder responsiveness, though it did
provide a good challenge to the course. Finally, the WIL ultimately felt pointless in the end when
we didn’t have an assignment on the deliverables that we sent to them; it was of our own
volition. Overall, the course gave me a lot of valuable skills, and could be even better with a few
adjustments.

                                            Week 6
​      This week, we presented the first assignment in class, which felt like it went reasonably
well, with a few vital pieces of feedback to take away. Most importantly, while we did a good job
explaining the market and our role in consulting for Pillflow, we lacked a depth of explanation
that would have shown that we understood what Pillflow actually does. This was an oversight
from our team as we were more focused on providing the specifics of what we are actually doing
for them that we skipped over the vital information that the audience may have needed.
​      Later in the week, we had a meeting with Alfred from Pillflow. This was our second
meeting so it was more productive in that we had a more in-depth understanding of what we
should be talking about for future success. Mainly, from our team's perspective, we wanted to
know more about all the work that Pillflow has done, so that we don’t just repeat and reiterate
their findings. Discussing their successes and failures also helped us to learn from and avoid
repeating these same mistakes to be the most effective. We discussed their initial pilot program,
being the Terry White Chemist that Viknesh works for, and how they initiated that process,
which helped us in gaining the confidence to do it ourselves. We also discussed the main
stakeholders that they wanted us to interview and reinforce their ideas with, with a main focus on
pharmacies, instead of GPs or caretakers.
​      Overall, the meeting was really useful in giving us a good launching point into
interviewing the stakeholders. We have formed a list of potential pharmacies that we will reach
out to over the next week or two and see what diversity of information we can get from them.
                                           Week 8
​      For starters, we have received our feedback from the first assignment presentation, and
we are curious about how we missed out on some vital information in the process. We didn’t talk
about the main pieces of theory that we talk about in class: lean startup, design thinking, and
effectuation. On a positive note, getting that feedback now can allow us to ensure that we apply it
going forward, which will hopefully lead us to be more successful with Pillflow.
​      Our team has sent out emails to about 15 pharmacies in the greater Brisbane area, with a
focus on smaller, non-chain pharmacies, though we have sent emails to larger ones as well. So
far, we have had no responses, which we were dreading; however, we still plan on going into
some pharmacies closer by to see who would be willing to talk to us. Unfortunately, the
pharmaceutical industry is quite an uncommunicative one; therefore, we will have to find
workarounds for these interviews, discussing with people not directly in the industry.
​      We also had another meeting with Alfred from Pillflow, it was a quick update but
provided some much-needed insight and developments that we can use. Most importantly, we
got a minimum viable product that we can use to more easily explain Pillflow to potential
stakeholders. This is vital as it will also help us in developing further recommendations for the
company to improve their existing work. Alfred helped walk us through it a bit and explored the
features that we can pass on in our interviews. This has definitely provided us the insight into
how important MVPs are for helping consumers understand your product, which I will use in my
future work.
                                           Week 10
​      Weeks 9 and 10 have been all about putting our heads down and getting the laborious
work done. Like we feared, not one pharmacy had responded to our contacts, and therefore, it
meant we had to interview other stakeholders who could provide us insight into the industry and
its pain points. I have had a few interviews up to this point, and they are less daunting than I
initially thought. I realised an interview can be a lot less formal than what it is thought to be. For
instance, one of the interviews that I have had is talking to a fellow designer who is working on a
similar issue that Pillflow is; however, they have deemed the right path is to fully revitalise the
MyHealthRecord App to be more user-friendly and useful. During this conversation, she
provided me with some useful insights into the industry that she had come across, and how
Pillflow will need to make sure they differentiate themselves from MyhealthRecord. She
reiterated the main hypothesised pain points that we and Pillflow had come across, such as,
people with multiple scripts can rarely use anything other than paper, as nothing is effective
enough, as well as people who change medications on a regular basis often find
MyHealthRecord useless because of its lack of unique features.
​      Another meeting that I had was with an ex-pharmacist in my family, who expressed
interest in the idea and helped reinforce some of our hypothesises. An insight that was provided
in this interview was the question of whether e-scripts would be a competitor or partner with
Pillflow, which is a valid question since e-scripts are a still emerging technology that could
directly compete with pillflows ideas.
​      These two interviews in particular have provided good insight, which will be brought to
Pillflow.
                               Mid-Semester Break
​      While it was important to me to get some much-needed rest over the mid-semester break,
I also took some time to catch up on assignments, in particular, finding some more insights that
could be useful for the Pillflow startup. Failing to get any responses from pharmacies from the
emails we sent them, I went into the chempro next to my house to see if I could talk to any of
them. Thankfully, it was relatively quiet, so I got to have a small chat with the two pharmacists
working there, mainly about pain points and using some lean startup to test some hypotheses.
The pharmacists reiterated pain points of slow response/update times from GPs, errors that can
and have been made in the current system with paper and e-scripts, and how having a universal
system of scripts, rather than either paper or digital, would be highly beneficial. Another major
pain point that I was enlightened to was that, with some really small practices, they still can do
handwritten scripts, which doctors are notorious for not having good handwriting. This makes
pharmacists' lives difficult since they have to do follow-ups to ensure they are filling the right
script. Overall, the conversation with the two from Chempro was quite insightful and helped me
to test a lot more hypotheses than other stakeholders.
​      Apart from that, during the mid-semester break, I spent some time working on the
deliverables that we would be sending to Pillflow at the end of the semester. With a good amount
of research behind me, I felt it was quite easy to create SWOT & SOAR diagrams of the
industry, exposing the competitors that Pillflow would need to prove themselves against. The
break was well-needed to make sure we were on track for the semester.
                                           Week 11
​       This week was some of the final chances we have to test assumptions, and do external
research before we really needed to start collating it into something that the guys at Pillflow
could easily understand and take use from. In class, we had a check-in, which unfortunately we
didn’t have the time to get to, but we still prepared the answer for, which allowed us a good
reflection on all the effort we’ve put in thus far. It allowed us to reflect on our assumptions,
collecting all the information into one place to see what we have found, and it also reinforced
what we learnt. Finally, it also had us reflect on our next steps and what more we need to put into
the upcoming weeks before the final delivery. Taking a second to step back and look at our work
and our next steps has given us a fresh perspective and renewed energy to finish the semester off.
This led us to one of our final meetings with the Pillflow guys, where both Viknesh and Alfred
were there for the first time.
​       This meeting allowed us to bring a good chunk of information that we had collected a
couple of weeks prior, to test our assumptions against the creators of the startup. Mainly, I
brought my concerns about security, similarity to MyHealthRecord, and the competition of
e-scripts to gauge their responses. Remarkably, they had concise and thoughtful responses to all
of them, which gave me insight into the skills of a startup that is passionate and has already done
a great amount of research. Overall, the meeting inspired my own skills as an entrepreneur, but it
was also good to see them reflect on their own work.
