When brainstorming for the project, I realized that practically every
“aloe” drink on the market has been sugary in nature. Interviews with
Gen Z and Millennial females also helped to clarify that their mindset
is much more aligned with values. People were looking for beverages that
helped with a self-care routine, rather than beverages that were simply
hydrating beverages with different packages (Osterwalder et al., 2014).
Additionally, an obvious benefit for the skin is achieved with the
consumption of these aloe juices. “How can we sell an aloe drink,”
transformed in my mind to “how can we make people feel good with their
lives?” The key takeaway from my WIL is to make choices within the
user’s needs in comparison to making choices in my own thoughts.

The hardest part for me was dealing with time constraints and my
tendency to over-plan. This experience highlighted the importance of
incorporating Lean Startup principles into approach: build something
minimal, test what’s valuable, and then quickly adapt from the findings.
We revised the survey to essential questions, considering it for
“minimum viable experimentation”. Then received feedback on benefits,
packaging, and branding.

There were two interpersonal challenges for me. First, I would obtain
qualitative feedback from Interview participants, translating it into a
specific benefit statement while also preserving scientific credibility;
Second, I would work on solutions according to the clients’ preferences
for aesthetics. I could de-personalize conversation and allow us to stay
on the same page with respect to evidence. I would use it sooner if I
were to do it over. Therefore, the WIL experience has taught me that
entrepreneurship is more about “designing learning loops,” from empathy
to framing, then experimentation, sense-making, and so on, rather than
“being right” (Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011).

I do see the develop of validated learning as the key capability in it.
I networked with:

- Teaching Staff/mentors (eg, Jack, Leah): Their valuable feedback
  helped us refine our experiments and stay grounded in a realistic
  opportunity.

- Target users: (eg, Pheng, Angelina) were prospective users who
  participated in our survey/interviews to establish a seed panel for
  testing in the future.

- Entrepreneurial community: (eg, Peter, Lisa): At the FaBa event, I
  networked with participants in general and made more in-depth
  connections with founders and experts.

Also, the feedback loops enabled us to accelerate learning, avoid wasted
efforts, and understand the step forward (Ries, 2014). We requested zoom
meetings, brainstormed ideas for co-marketing, and contacted mentors who
would give us feedback through the process. All these connections made
up a living network for collaboration and learning that consistently
directed us on the path for the development of our ventures.

Before this course, I possessed curiosity in branding, visual
storytelling, and well-structured writing. I had heard of Design
Thinking and Lean, but I had never experienced each from start to
finish. I also had a bias toward careful planning and polishing. This is
useful for quality, but risky for early-stage innovation where
uncertainty is high. The remarkable aspect for us was the de-risking
nature of empathy in strategy formation. We discovered that consumers do
not buy ingredients themselves in the products they purchase. Moreover,
they buy stories, credentials associated with benefits offered in
products (Osterwalder et al., 2014). We started with “aloe for
hydration,” then embarked on “skin-related self-care activities”.

In the Lean Startup, “minimum viable experiment” approach prompted me to
think in terms of a learning goal before any build: “What is the
uncertainty that threatens us the most at the moment, and what is the
cheapest way to test it?” We optimized the survey to only ask the most
necessary questions, improving our signals with more certainty in each
iteration cycle. Also, I also started thinking in terms of an experiment
with strict performance metrics associated with each booth visitor’s
ability to remember the key benefit of the brand in a certain time
frame. Our limitations, like time constraints, budget, or availability,
were turned into strengths. Effectuation Theory played an integral part
in encouraging me to act effectively with fewer resources in hand rather
than pursuing perfectionism.

I improved my skills in preparing informative and neutral research
questions, carrying out interviews quickly. Also, I used qualitative
research notes into themes with respect to "taste," convenience, “brand
clarity,” and “beauty from within,” credibility accordingly. In
addition, I refined my skills in using the appropriate consent
terminology during these research operations with attention to
appropriate research data “hygiene." This WIL changed my identity from
'Student who likes branding’ to 'Venture designer who can take messy
insight into testable value’. I am interested in pursuing opportunities
and ventures in the areas where wellness, consumer products, and
branding intersect (Clark et al., 2012). I am setting myself on a path
in accordance with a personal operating system that embraces effectual
partnering and the careful assembly of complementary collaborators.

What I appreciated the most in the course were activities within the
FaBa event, meeting industry professionals, and other participants. Real
exposure is so much quicker than theoretical exercises. The
opportunities to have mentor meetings with Jack and Leah, helped us
avoid analysis paralysis and keep moving forward. In this way, it
possible for us to carry out our experiments with more accuracy.
According to the effectual logic employed by Sarasvathy in 2022, whereby
partnerships were leveraged for progress due to collective learning
instead of predictions.

For future iterations, three specific improvements would better enhance
the learning experience. First, providing a “Minimum Experiment
Library”, a set of 8–10 pre-designed templates such as claim-clarity
card sorts, five-second brand recall tests, or simplified
price-sensitivity checks. Alongside an ethics and consent checklist,
would help beginners start faster while maintaining discipline. Second,
introducing a mid-semester “micro-demo day”, a brief showcase, would
highlight spots earlier and alleviate end-of-semester stress. Third, the
possibly of a small prototype budget and a pre-approved vendor list for
local printing or sampling would allow physical prototyping on a more
feasible, enriching real-world learning without subjecting individuals
to excessive personal costs.

What I would do differently next time All through the WIL experience, I
have experienced personal development in terms of adopting a practice
shift from perfection-seeking planning to adaptive experimentation. I
started with an organized, content-driven mind-set for innovation, I
wanted to perfect every single phrase, every single survey question,
every single design aspect before subjecting it to testing with others
(Ries, 2014). However, using it with real users under time constraints
helped me understand that in the world of entrepreneurship, it is not
perfection that counts but rather learning quickly and learning it
right.

Emotionally, I also became more familiar with the constructs of
uncertainty and ambiguity. While engaging in each interview and each
booth conversation, I am constantly reminded that feedback from users is
more likely to refute what I think I know rather than validate it. Far
from considering it a problem to be overcome, I have come to view it
instead as valuable feedback for iteration. At an interpersonal level, I
realized I could appreciate more the power of collaboration in the
creative process (Sarasvathy, 2022). By working with other team members,
mentors, and users, I realized that the power of innovation is never an
individual’s endeavor but rather an effectual collaboration.

I would say that this adventure in WIL has transformed my professional
self, my professional life, in addition to changing my personal values.
I look forward to being more than a student engaged with branding, but
also a thinker who can act on ideas, who can convert uncertainty into
opportunities. I look forward to operating in the link between wellness,
branding, and social innovation, where the approaches would be driven by
empathy and experimentation. I have also learned to appreciate progress
rather than perfection, learning instead of prediction, and
collaboration instead of control.

First Entry August 22, 2025

As we were initially brainstorming for HEXPO, I realized that most of
the “aloe” beverages in the market were high in sugar and artificial
ingredients. Also, during primary research, it came to pass that many
females were concerned with the aspect that they would want something
that fit their lifestyle preferences for themselves, rather than their
hydration levels. Also, the concept for “Aloe Vita,” a natural
skin-focused “aloe” drink with Aussie farmers, came into being.

By integrating this process, instead of asking, “How can we sell an aloe
drink?” I re-framed it into “How can we help women feel good while
staying healthy?” By completing the Empathize and Define steps within
Design Thinking, I realized that it is more appropriate to understand
emotional needs rather than functional needs, rather than designing a
product.

This was significant because it placed the human foundation of the
project. Aloe Vita wasn't built on assumptions but built on empathy.
Realizing that was a shift in my own mind from creating a "product" to
creating value that matters that connects health, beauty, and self-care.

Second Entry September 6, 2025

When we were preparing for HEXPO, we realized that it is important to
test assumptions regarding the reasons individuals would be attracted to
Aloe Vita. I assisted in preparing a two-minute survey for validating
awareness of competition, benefits of preference, such as health
benefits for digestion and skin, and package preference. When we were
conducting reviews with Leah, we reduced all the questions to only the
most significant ones that would test well in early validation.

Applying the Lean Startup Build-Measure-Learn loop, coming up with these
questionnaires required only a “minimum viable experiment.” All these
answers helped in understanding the perceptions these Gen Z, as well as
Millennials, have towards health beverages.

I understood that the idea of validation is more about finding the truth
rather than providing evidence for beliefs that I thought were true
already. By making the survey simpler, thus dedicating less time to it,
yet providing valuable branding insights, we were able to swiftly
collect key indications for the next step in the iteration process. I
also learned that it is possible that the start-up habit for affordably
testing instead of overplanning could be essential in the start-up
phase.

Third Entry September 25, 2025

The market research among consumers shows that almost the entire group
relied on water, with some on kombucha or protein milk. While health
drinks were rated according to their “taste, convenience, and ease of
understanding of branding,” with some respondents considering collagen
powders for their “skin health benefits”. This shows that consumers
correlate “beauty from within” with transparency, rather than
health-related ambiguity. These processes helped me understand better
consumers’ behavior.

All these were classic Design Thinking Empathy-driven activities, where
we uncovered things that truly matter to users. It also aligned with the
problem validation step in Lean Startup because it disproved our
assumptions early on. I realized that consumers do not buy ingredients;
they buy stories, they buy credibility. The key benefit line with strong
natural ingredients, and an accessible distribution path. It is an
important step in that it turns ideas into design principles, closing
the gap between research and design for products.

HEXPO proved to be a huge success for Leah. Despite feeling drained from
meeting so many people in a single day, it proved to be an incredibly
uplifting experience for her. She got to network with industry experts,
other founders, and even a couple of venture capitalists who showed an
interest in Aloe Vita and invited her to talk more about it in the
future. Leah also has several leads to pursue in the coming week to take
things forward. Friday’s weather was poor, and because the event was
semi-outdoor the expected turnout of around 220 fell to roughly 160. It
was challenging to secure survey completions at the booth. Most visitors
preferred to chat and hear the story behind Aloe Vita. Therefore,
despite placing two QR codes at either end. Across both surveys, Leah’s
team collected 52 responses, approximately 32% of attendees.

Fourth Entry October 7,2025

At FaBA, Leah showcased the story of “Aloe Vita,” and “Grab & Glow,”
which is its visual branding concept. Observing the reception from the
consumers at the booth provided immediate feedback on the design
thinking from our product design. Some participants were pleased with
the concept of “Aloe Vita,” but others thought that aloe beverages were
for their seniors.

At this level, the team is operating in the Design Thinking Test phase
that also corresponds to another iteration within the
Build-Measure-Learn Cycle. As the team has been able to test the body
language responses in an unscripted manner, it has been possible for the
team to identify opportunities as well as misconceptions on the part of
the respondents in the test. The end-users have been a source of big
surprises for the team; their enthusiasm for the “skin forward” concept
has validated the strategy, but their misunderstanding on the
conventional knowledge of aloe has done just the opposite.

Fifth Entry October 15, 2025

As I ended the placement, I looked back at everything I had
accomplished. From conceptual design to testing by experimentation,
entrepreneurship is a path that is constantly learning rather than
striving for perfection. Overcoming the challenge of limited
availability led me to understand the Bird-in-Hand principle from the
Effectuation principle. In other words, doing something with what we
have, who we know, and with what we can do with it here and now. I
realized I have a superpower in the area of creative integration and
execution, which is translating user knowledge into branding strategy. I
also realized I had a vulnerability in overdoing preparation for
execution, which I counteract by trusting in the power of rapid
experimentation. All these are critical principles since
entrepreneurship is not an act of making businesses; rather, it is an
act that creates capabilities in terms of reflective thinking,
adaptability, and empathy for others. Meanwhile, I realized Aloe Vita
believes conducting interesting innovation is accomplished in
collaboration between human intuition, lean experimentation, and
effectual action.
