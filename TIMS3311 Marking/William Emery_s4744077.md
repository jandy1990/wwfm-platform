Critical Reflection Essay

Overall WIL Experience
Personal lessons
Over the past two months, working on my own startup has enabled me to learn much
more than I would in a traditional classroom setting, and has also provided a
valuable opportunity for introspection. I chose Option 2 of the Work Integrated
Learning pathways to overcome a longtime barrier: paralysis from feeling “I didn’t
know enough” to launch a venture. The most valuable lesson has been recognising
that perfectionism hinders entrepreneurship. I’ve learned to embrace uncertainty and
step out of my comfort zone, addressing challenges as they appear while staying
agile and adaptive. This hands-on approach has enabled me to master the
fundamentals of 3D printing, including different filaments, 3D CAD software as well
as printing constraints and tolerances. I’ve also sharpened my soldering and
programming abilities. Importantly, I’ve learned to conduct stakeholder interviews
that validate the problem, rather than simply receiving validation for my product.
One of the highlights so far has been securing funding from UQ Ventures through the
Validate program ($1,500), a symbol of persistence and pitching ability. Further, the
creation of my MVP was a significant milestone, and was rewarding to see the core
concept work after numerous failed iterations. However, motivation has been my
biggest challenge. Some days I wake up enthused and prototype for hours; other
days I would question whether the product is worth developing or doubt the productmarket fit. On unproductive days, this feeling would exacerbate. I’ve spent many
hours writing and debugging code that ultimately wouldn’t work. I also had some
troubles getting the microcontroller (the brain of the device) to work, sometimes
finding the device would get stuck looping on previous code, requiring me to take the
device apart, remove the chip and begin a laborious process resetting it.
To alleviate these challenges, I time-boxed my work around specific problems. If
code wasn’t functioning, I’d devote a set time to fix it, then deliberately switch tasks.
This prevented tunnel vision and burnout. I also leveraged my network for testing,
brainstorming and debugging electrical issues. My design classmates were

particularly helpful in challenging my assumptions about what the device should do,
look like and feel like, preventing me from becoming too attached to my initial vision,
In hindsight, I would have recruited a cofounder with programming skills early in the
process. This would have freed me to focus on product design, which is my strength
and passion. Since my coding abilities are rudimentary, someone with better skills
could have been a strong addition to help ideate quicker and provided a collaborator
for feature development.

Networks established
UQ Related:
Designers: I have strengthened my connections with designers including,
Leon who ran the internship I did last year, Benny and Dan (two industrial
designers) who I met this semester.
Peers: I have met several new people in my design and entrepreneurship
courses, who have helped me test my product, provide insightful suggestions
in and out of class, discuss my progress and challenge my core assumptions.
Entrepreneurship: UQ Ventures facilitators and staff: Tomas, David, Hein
and Tyson. UQ Ventures peers: Ned, Tania, Armando, Philip, Ethan, Joh. UQ
Ventures Mentors: Noah, Martyn and Elli. UQ Business School: Jack, Tahlia.
Other startup founders from iLab and Momentum accelerator programs whom
I met during UQ Venture’s ‘scaleUp’ events.

Non-UQ Affiliated:
Industry: ARM HUB staff at their prototyping facility in Northgate.
IP Contacts: Email addresses of lawyers with IP specialisations.

The greatest value I have gained from my network is from my mentors and peers
providing feedback on the user experience of my product and engaging in deep
conversations with me about my vision, often challenging my assumptions about

what this product should look like, who my target market is, and supporting the
development of my iterations by offering constructive criticisms and suggestions
about my device.

New Knowledge, Insights and Skills
The Past
Prior to this course, I was well informed about the Design Thinking process, but less
informed about the Lean Startup and Effectuation processes. As a design student,
empathy mapping and prototyping are tools I have used many times before and are
confident in using. Through the Innovation and Entrepreneurship major I have been
exposed to the Lean Startup methodology and Effectuation but was less confident
with these approaches as I had only grappled with them in a theoretical lens. I knew
that Lean Startup was about testing assumptions quickly and cheaply and that
Effectuation was about leveraging the resources in your network and surrounding,
but not much beyond that.

Key Learnings
Throughout the semester, I have learned that entrepreneurship is not about having
the perfect idea from the start, but rather, about experimenting, learning and
continuously adapting. The most important insight was understanding that
uncertainty is not something to eliminate, but something to navigate through
iterations, co-creation and strategic problem solving. This mentality inspired me to
start small, test assumptions early and use the resources at my disposal to create
progress quickly.
This mindset was central to developing my physical device, which underwent nine
iterations. This rapid prototyping allowed me to learn through discovery, working out
the correct button spacing, dimensions and ergonomics. Since filament is cheap, I
could afford to experiment quickly, learning from each print. This iterative process
matches the Lean Startup’s build-measure-learn loop, teaching me to validate
assumptions through early testing, rather than focusing on the ‘polish’ of the product

(Ries, 2014). In future projects, I plan to use this approach to refine ideas efficiently,
before committing significant time or resources.
As the design matured, I engaged peers, friends and mentors to gather feedback on
my MVP. These discussions revealed a key insight about product-market fit: even a
technically sophisticated and novel product can fail if it does not solve a real need. In
testing, users demonstrated a preference for a compact, handheld device, rather
than the original tabletop design I had envisioned. By adapting the size and adjusting
the ergonomics to ensure each button was in thumb’s reach, I improved usefulness
and desirability. This is an example of ‘validated learning’ where feedback loops
transform assumptions into data-driven insights (Blank, 2013). The most valuable
learning is that conducting many interviews with diverse perspectives leads to better
design outcomes with a stronger alignment to market demands, an approach I plan
to carry into my future design work through co-creation with stakeholders.
Early in the semester, I faced a tough decision between developing Acuity, or
creating a journalling app. I chose Acuity since it best aligned with my passions,
experience and available skills. Specifically, I already understood the problem space
well through my experience as a tutor, had experience with wiring and CAD software,
and could access feedback from industrial designers in my professional network. By
leveraging current resources and skills rather than chasing unfamiliar ones, I was
able to move fast and effectively. This decision reflects the Effectuation principle,
‘bird-in-hand’, which emphasises starting with who you are, what you know and who
you know (Sarasvathy, 2001). Importantly, seeking feedback from Leon, an industrial
designer contact of mine, added some ideas to increase the polish and practicality
for later iterations. As my network expands, I plan to apply the bird-in-hand principle
in future projects, allowing me to experiment in different fields using resources and
connections already available to me.

The Future
My WIL experience has had an important impact on my career trajectory, as I intend
on continuing the startup I have formed into the future. It has been a long-time goal
of mine to invent a product or service and bring it to life, and I see my experience
developing Acuity as the manifestation of this journey. The skills and network I have
gained over this product-development sprint will continue with me into the future as I
further develop the product and eventually build other products as well. My WIL
experience has influenced my thinking by giving me the confidence to build a
business from the ground up and knowing that I won’t have everything figured out
from the start but will find the way over the course of the journey.

Course Feedback
I have valued the 1-on-1 consults each week as this has been a productive way to
ask questions, check in on progress and receive actionable insights and
suggestions.
Suggestions for improvement:
(1) I thought that the class check-in in week 11 was helpful for gaining insights
from other teams about their approaches. I found this was a good way to learn
from others and provided a comfortable atmosphere to receive assistance
from peers. In future if there was another one of these check-ins earlier,
perhaps before mid-sem break, I believe that would be helpful.
(2) To improve assessment 1, I would add clarification about the ‘week
numbering’. I mistakenly thought that the weeks were in relation to the uni
semester, rather than our own venture. Providing some clarity is a simple fix
that could prevent confusion.
(3) I found this opportunity to create my own startup to be very worthwhile, and I
suggest highlighting to future students that WIL pathway 2 might be more
work but is also potentially a more valuable / fulfilling way to learn lots about
starting a business and about yourself. Personally, I would recommend this
option to anyone who has an idea that they haven’t acted upon yet.

Entry #1: Low Fidelity Prototype analysis (14/9/2025)
Today was a huge milestone as I completed my ﬁrst low-ﬁdelity prototype. While I have
made prototypes before, this marks the ﬁrst one that assembles as one complete
device and has functioning lights and button clicking effects. This development is
important as it signiﬁes that I have navigated prior problems sufficiently to hold all
pieces in place which is a great feat for me being new to product design. Applying the
lean startup principle of testing cheaply, I designed this without full MVP functionality,
as a way of testing the size of the device, how it looks, and to gain quick feedback from
users. My key takeaways from this low-ﬁ prototype are learning about 3D printing
tolerances and that users had challenges clicking buttons quickly, as they were spaced
out too-much that the user had to lay it down on a ﬂat surface and use their pointer
ﬁngers. Ideally, I would like the product to be ergonomic, handheld with each button
reachable from thumbs. For the next iteration I will:
-

move the buttons closer together,
reduce the overall size of the product,
make the shape more rounded, to provide ergonomic groves to hold on better,
reduce the vertical height to make it slimmer, solder the buttons and code some
games to test it in action.

Entry #2: UQ Ventures Mentor Conversations (24/9/2025)
In today’s Validate session, we had guest speaker Martyn Asser join us, providing a
keynote speech followed by 1-on-1 feedback joined by a range of other mentors.
Martyn’s talk was based on his personal experience as a door-to-door salesman, and
his progression to own his own marketing business, where he now leads a team of
salesmen. A key insight I took away from Martyn’s chat, is that sales is a “transfer of
energy”, where the salesperson’s enthusiasm and affinity to the product assists with the
sale. He mentioned some titbits of psychology, like how giving someone the opportunity
to talk about their day is a strong way to make a connection and be on the ‘same page’.
During the mentor conversations, I told Martyn about my startup and my question to
him was:
“What is your advice to someone like myself trying to sell a product that is in part
intwined with my identity, as in, how do I navigate rejection of my product without taking
it personally?”
Martyn explained that rejection from a sale goes both ways. He said that it is not them
rejecting you, it is them simply saying the product is not right for them at that point in
time. Martyn’s advice was a valuable point of self-discovery as he made me realise that
a sales rejection goes both ways. As in, I am looking for the right people to buy my
product, and if someone declines the offering, it is equivalent of me ﬁnding out that they
aren’t the right ﬁt. In this Ventures session, I also met Ned and Tania, who are two other
participants with projects in adjacent problem spaces, expanding my network and
creating opportunities for collaborations.

Entry #3: Feedback from Leon, Isaac and Sean (9/10/2025)
Today I met with Leon, a designer who led my internship last year. I reached out to him,
as I ﬁgured I should leverage design expertise in my network to validate the physical
design of the product, and get his thoughts on the user experience of the device.
Overall, Leon was impressed with the form factor and size and gave recommendations
of integrating a rechargeable battery. This was a useful insight as I had previously
thought using double-A batteries would be the best option, but I agree with him that a
rechargeable battery gives the device a more polished, higher quality feel, rather than a
toy (which often use double A’s). Leon’s perspective was valuable as being a designer
himself, he is very in-tune with the design thinking approach and was able to suggest
different experiments that I could run cheaply. These included, adding rubber feet to the
design to prevent it from slipping if using it on a tabletop, playing with the ﬁnish of the
device, potentially have a clear or frosted component, and adding a speaker to give
more potential game modes (e.g. a game that requires a user to remember a sound and
a colour, increasing the complexity and requiring closer concentration. After this, in my
design class I spoke with two of my classmates Isaac and Sean who assisted with more
in-depth feedback and prolonged experimentation with the device. I learned that the
‘Colour memory’ game instructions were unclear, as both users required my assistance
to understand how to play the game correctly. I also received suggestions about other
use-cases for the device, such as a mental warm-down or a ‘reset’ game that allows you
to ‘cleanse the mental palette’ after a bout of focused work.

Entry #4: Ventures Validate Interview (15/10/2025)
This morning, I attended the ARM HUB facilities as part of an excursion for a design
course that I tutor (Design Prototyping). This exposed me to another potential avenue of
expertise and resources, as this facility is dedicated towards helping startups and
organisations prototype and develop their products. Although their facilities are more
tailored towards engineering-based startups, (e.g. Robotics and Aircraft), I got the
business card of the lead engineer who might be able to get me in touch of a injectionmoulding facility, which could help me prototype on a larger scale.
In the afternoon, I travelled back to UQ for my presentation as part of the Validate
program. This consisted of a 10-minute conversation with Tomas Piccinini, showcasing
my startup’s progress and evidence of validation. After, I asked Tomas if he knew of
anyone that could help me understand Intellectual Property in greater detail, to which I
was provided with some email addresses of contacts that could help me.
*Later that week on Friday I received an email from the Validate team informing me that
I had won $1,500 to assist me in funding operations of my startup! This was a key
milestone that signiﬁes two things: (1) the Validate team see potential in my idea, pitch
and product. (2) I have dedicated money which I will put towards larger-scale
prototyping to offer my ﬁrst product on market.

Entry #5: UQ Ventures Startup Showcase (18/10/2025)
Today I attended UQ Venture’s Startup showcase, an event with a mixture of keynote
speakers (Luke Anear from SafetyCulture), panel conversations from previous iLab
competitors, workshops and networking opportunities with likeminded individuals.
Hearing Luke’s keynote speech, I was inspired to continue pushing through with my
startup, even if it feels like I don’t have everything ﬁgured out currently. Luke shared how
tackling new problems day-by-day becomes part of the fun and shared how his journey
was a path of experimentation and learning through failures. His story is reminiscent of
the Lean Startup principles as he described starting his company from his garage, and
spending money on trial-and-error development, learning from mistakes as quickly as
possible. Luke shared a valuable point about being ‘comfortable with uncertainty’ and
how ‘speed is the new currency’ that allows small ﬁrms to outpace larger organisations.
I found this perspective insightful, and it gave me more conﬁdence to continue pushing
my project towards commercialisation, even if I sometimes feel out of my depths. In the
second half of the day, I attended the ‘Funding Seminar’ led by UQ Venture’s Yazz and
Vanessa. In this session, I learned the different types of investment and their pros and
cons. This allowed me to clarify the terms ‘funding’, ‘equity’ and ‘capital’, and dispel the
myth that Venture Capital is the optimal pathway for startups. In my case, a valuable
conversation with Vanessa informed me that crowdfunding is likely an optimal source of
funding for my startup, as it allows me to maintain equity and control. At this point,
Angel investment and venture capital misaligns with my vision, mostly because they
carry strict expectations of proﬁtability and are often biased against product inventions.
I’m more interested in providing impact for a select niche market, exposing my deeper
belief that chasing proﬁt leads to mission drift, and deviates from the spark that got the
startup moving in the ﬁrst place.
