# Critical Reflection 

## 1.1 Overall WIL Experience

### Personal lessons 

Throughout this course I have garnered many valuable insights from how
I’ve personally dealt with and reacted to the challenges I’ve faced. The
first being my ability to lead. Although there is room for improvement,
I believe that I was effective in my role of team leader, taking on the
added responsibility of communication between the start-up and the team.
I’ve also come to the realisation that I am far more productive when I
am working on something that I’m genuinely passionate about, as I had
put more hours into perfecting my MVP poster in an editing software and
went to further lengths to learn more about Eclipse and the innovation
space as a whole. Attending the SomethingQ innovation event in the heart
of Brisbane’s innovation and entrepreneurship district was certainly a
highlight. Watching the founders pitch their start-up’s was intriguing,
as I got to experience what I might be doing myself in the future.
Visiting the Eclipse Lab for a tour of their facility and a Q&A with
their science team was also a major highlight for me, as I got a better
look at what it really takes to make a venture like Eclipse actually
come to fruition. I also enjoyed talking to consumers about my MVP’s
when I travelled to the gold coast to get those new revelations and
ideas. However, In saying this, determining how I was actually going to
create and test my MVP’s was a difficulty I faced. Eclipse hadn’t yet
started mass producing a fully refined lactoferrin powder so I had no
physical MVP to develop and or test. In lieu of this, we created
detailed concept posters as the next best option. Organising and
delegating tasks was another challenge I faced. My teammate didn’t seem
to be as invested as I am in producing the best possible outcome for
Eclipse, meaning there was more pressure on me to pick up the slack. I
dealt with this by simply working harder, but in hindsight would have
had a formal talk about our respective responsibilities.

### Networks established 

As part of my MVP testing process I had discussed with my friend Savana,
about visiting her gym to talk to their customers and to show them the
posters I had made. I had interviewed her previously and she is
genuinely interested in the product. I believe that in fostering this
relationship, there is a very real opportunity for a future partnership
and or further gathering of consumer data. I also believe that by
attending the various extracurricular events such as the innovation
mixer and the Eclipse lab tour, I have developed rapport with Siobhan
(CEO of Eclipse). This network could support my future endeavours of
working in the business science field of innovation.

## 1.2 New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills

My Past

Prior to this experience I have undertaken the majority of courses
needed to complete my degree, having been exposed to the Lean start-up
approach and effectuation methodologies many times. I have had
experience in ideating and validating an entrepreneurial opportunity,
specifically though completing TIMS3302. My team and I created Skyfair,
an uber like business model for delivering items from overseas in spare
passenger luggage space. Throughout investigating this opportunity, we
were tasked with stating and validating our assumptions, which in doing
so was extremely insightful. I have also briefly worked with a startup
called Pure Homes, where I managed social media outlets and CRM tasks.
This start-up had already created their MVP and was in the process of
reaching out to their first customers, so I did not get to employ many
of the entrepreneurial skills I had learned throughout my degree. Before
starting the course, I was confident in my ability to implement the Lean
start-up approach but had little to no experience in applying the
effectuation and design thinking methodologies in practice.

### Key learnings 

The most pivotal entrepreneurial framework used throughout my experience
with Eclipse was the lean start-up approach. I started by conducting
desktop research in order to complete our BMEM (Amarsy, 2015). Using
this tool allowed me to clearly visualise the market forces and consumer
trends, which facilitated the discovery of two potential product market
fits. I then created two consumer profiles using the BMEM and
subsequently actioned the core activity of the lean start up approach by
conducting ten problem interviews (Croll & Yoskovitz, 2013). The
assumptions made in our consumer profiles being that older women want
improved gut health and younger active men want faster muscle recovery
were proven false during these interviews. However, we did learn that
the younger people we interviewed were more accepting of the genetic
engineering aspect of lactoferrin and that the women were interested in
hormone balancing and iron boosting benefits. Thus, we pivoted our
target market to young/middle-aged active women. At this point in the
WIL experience, I started to appreciate the power of the lean start up
approach and how my failures in validating our initial target market
could easily be turned into new opportunities for further investigation.

Additional interviews with our new target demographic provided some
evidence in validating our assumptions that young/middle-aged active
women want iron boosting and muscle recovery benefits. This was
promising as we could now start working on our MVP’s. Although going
about creating them was a challenge. I had no clue where to start and
had no actual product to work with as Eclipse had yet to produce a
finalised product and gain regulatory approval for human consumption. In
order to figure out how I was going to create and test my MVP’s I used
Sarasvathy’s effectuation theory, which asks entrepreneurs to look at
the resources they currently have at hand (DC Correspondent, 2019). I
did this by first creating a means inventory, detailing who I am, what I
know and who I know (Effectuation, n.d.). I am kind and respectful
making it more likely for people to want to help me. I know how to edit
photos and videos and have had experience outsourcing printing services
at Officeworks. I also know people who frequent the gym and have a
friend Savana who I met at the beginning of the year who owns a gym.
Outlining my means inventory using effectuation allowed me to identify a
way to create my MVP’s by utilising my known skills, strengths and
capabilities. Therefore, we chose concept posters instead of something
like an interactive online landing page. Linking the other aspects
outlined in my means inventory also revealed a way in which I can test
them in an environment where our target market would be. This
environment being my friend’s gym in the Gold Coast. I travelled there
to test the concept posters but due to external circumstances, namely
the hot weather unexpectedly reducing the class size, resulted in fewer
customer interactions than expected.

The Future

I’ve come to realise over the course of my experience working with
Eclipse that the process for identifying a product market fit is not
straight forward and neither is the Lean startup framework itself. I
believe that it is a great point in which to start and mantra to follow,
but as long as I was adopting an agile, iterative and adaptive approach
towards validating assumptions, I found new opportunities and made
progress. I would like to adopt the same approach towards how I
investigate new opportunities in my life such as searching for a job or
perhaps even starting my own venture. While touring the Eclipse lab, I
also gained an appreciation for versatility in individual capabilities,
as I saw many ways in which my various skills could be valuable to the
Eclipse team and potentially other ventures. By working with Eclipse, I
have genuinely uncovered a fascination with how food science and
business intertwine. My future career trajectory will thus, be aimed at
working with a venture pursuing innovative food science products.

Course feedback

Throughout my experience of the course, I have come to value the freedom
we are given the most. The freedom to charter our own path, to fail, to
succeed and in doing so, make genuine discoveries about how the process
of innovation and consumer/product discovery works in a real-life
situation. Myself, like many others found consumer interviews to be a
difficult activity to complete. I believe that developing a way for
groups to attain at least a couple of guaranteed interviewees would be
ideal. Perhaps during one in person class there could be a discussion to
see if the target consumer of any group and the people in class match
for potential interview opportunities. Another idea for improvement
could be the implementation of events or outside class meetings in
public spaces around UQ for groups to approach consumers in a less
daunting environment. I also believe that there should be a weighting
system in place for smaller and larger groups as a group of two like
mine won’t be able to achieve as much as a group of five.

# 3.0 Diary Entries 

## 3.1 Entry 1 

16/9/2025

The past week including today has been devoted to creating our business
model environmental map (BMEM) following the lean start-up approach as
well as beginning to conduct customer interviews. Through conducting
secondary desktop research in order to complete the BMEM I found
evidence in the form of peer reviewed scientific papers, supporting the
health benefit claims of lactoferrin. Gut health and anti-inflammatory
(recovery) properties seemed to be the most common benefits people
sought in functional F&B products, aligning with what lactoferrin can
provide. Therefore, I created two consumer profiles to target each
benefit, one being a younger male who frequents the gym and wants to
improve muscle mass and muscle recovery and another segment for older
women (40 and up) who want to improve their gut health. Through
conducting problem interviews, I found that the young male segment was
not very interested in the benefits of lactoferrin as their needs were
already being sufficiently met and additionally place more importance on
product price. I also found that the older woman segment placed less
importance on their gut health than what was evident through online
research, in other words, they don’t priorities their gut health over
other wellness needs and don’t go out of their way to choose functional
foods to fix it. I also found that older individuals aren’t as open to
the idea of consuming products associated with concepts such as genetic
engineering. However, there was some interest in the potential benefit
of iron boosting properties. This information led me to pivot our target
market and aim to further investigate younger women who might be more
interested in the iron support benefit of lactoferrin.

## 3.2 Entry 2 

2/10/2025

Through our interviews Elliot and myself have received evidence to
suggest that our new target market being younger women would be
interested in the iron support and anti-inflammatory benefits of
lactoferrin. The most common supplement/functional F&B product for
active people who want to grow muscle is protein powder and another
commonly consumed functional F&B product is a standalone drink you would
pick up off a shelf. I spent some time using the means inventory
effectuation principle to help me figure out how to start creating and
testing our MVP’s. We decided on and created two potential MVP concept
posters to test these product ideas. One poster depicted a standalone
drink which had Eclipse’s logo on it and in writing “ Female sports
drink”, “Reduces muscle Inflammation”. While the other poster showed two
different packaging styles for a protein powder that helps with Iron
support, having “Iron tablet and protein powder in one” in writing. I
finalised the posters and sent them off to Officeworks to be printed and
laminated and then went to pick them up. This was an expense to me but
made me realise that in the pursuit of any quality information resources
will have to be invested.

## 3.3 Entry 3

8/10/2025

Today I travelled to my friends gym called EmpoweredHQ in the Gold Coast
to conduct my MVP testing. I had organised to visit her gym yesterday
but ended up going today instead due to traffic and other factors.
Travelling so far was taxing and costly but was worth it in my opinion.
Having a friend who has authority in a certain environment like a gym
allowed me to more confidently approach people and allowed the people I
approached to be more forthcoming and open with their feedback. I
believe this resulted in more valuable insights. A comment on the
darkness of colours on the posters I used implied that using lighter
more feminine colours would improve the attractiveness of the product
(Eclipses website colours were used, dark blue and aqua). Another
comment about wanting a light, fruity drink made me believe that my
target market would appreciate a more light-hearted, simple product like
a protein water drink rather than a protein powder or dairy based drink,
to which the person I was talking too and who had made the comment
confirmed. I was unfortunately only able to talk to a couple people due
to a lot of no shows, but my friend was able to take the posters and
show them to other classes happening later in the day. She recorded the
feedback she received and will send it to me soon.

## 3.4 Entry 4 

13/10/2025

A couple days ago, myself and two other students travelled to the
Gardens Point QUT campus to visit the Eclipse lab. The purpose of this
for me was out of sheer curiosity and love for the sciences behind the
manufacturing process of lactoferrin. We toured the lab where we were
showed the equipment and processes and were then introduced to the
science team to ask questions. I believe that this experience really
highlighted my strengths, in particular my ability to comprehend the
deeper science behind a given product which could then be utilised to
better inform any future business decisions.

Throughout the tour I was introduced to different teams which each
focussed on separate facets of the business. One being the science team
who managed the modification and improvement of their yeast cells in
producing lactoferrin. Another being the team which tested the different
cells and optimised the production of actual protein powder. From this I
discovered an appreciation for the complexity of science based products
in business and the importance of diversity, specialisation and
delegation of tasks in the pursuit of success.

## 3.5 Entry 5 

20/10/2025

Siobhan (CEO of Eclipse), has gone overseas for a business trip and has
left us to complete the work we set out to do. I feel as though I have
put in quite a considerable amount of energy and effort into creating
the best outcome for this assignment and the start-up. However I feel as
though it is still not enough, as we have yet to find a desirable
solution to the question we set out to solve. I believe that we are
close but still require more data to achieve the desired outcome. I have
made an attempt to visit the Wednesday market stalls at the UQ campus
but was rejected as we did not have wares to sell. This is a setback but
will be overcome. I have made advances in organising more interviews and
will hopefully get the further insights we need. Through adopting the
Lean start-up approach I have found that while pivoting is essential in
remaining agile and adaptable it does appear as a setback and requires a
collective effort to persevere. Through my interviews and customer
interactions I have learnt that a protein water and standalone drink
might be more appealing to the market we are targeting. In order to
effectively test this I will have to create and print another MVP
poster.
