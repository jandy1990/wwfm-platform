# Critical Reflection

## Highlights

One key highlight from the WIL experience was making \$15 in revenue
within one week. My team brainstormed and hypothesised that weekly zoom
meetup planning sessions would help 18–24-year-olds form high-quality
friendships, and they will be willing to pay \$5 to participate. We set
up a website and advertised our ideas on social media. In one week, we
had 3 paid registrations for our Zoom planning session for
18–24-year-olds. This resulted in a get together of 5 people at South
Bank for the movie Bad Guys 2.

## Challenges

We struggled to gather enough interest beyond that point. In response,
we performed interviews to get an understanding of (1) why our idea
lacked interest and (2) what people may want instead. We learnt that the
zoom sessions had negative associations with work, and people would
rather spend that time attending a social event than planning social
events with strangers. People prefer pre-planned, low-effort and
low-commitment events that they can schedule weeks in advance (people
are busy). The events should centre around specific interests or goals,
and should combine casual fun with deeper meaning. Hence, the next
solution we will test is weekly events for small groups that allow for
deeper connection. These groups include people of similar age, interests
and availability.

Another key difficulty was poor work quality or a lack of collaboration
from my teammates. For our first presentation in TIMS3311, my teammates
placed URLs in our reference list instead doing proper APA referencing,
they put our script on the PowerPoint slides (instead of formatting the
slides with minimal text and some visual graphics), they created
PowerPoint slides for certain sections but not a script, and they had a
long delay in responding to my messages. For all of those things, I
performed a performance review and gave feedback using the sandwich
method. For the APA referencing and slides, I re-did those myself. For
the group chat response times, I reformatted the way we did things to
rather have a weekly Zoom meeting.

However, I had to remove one of the team members from the group (who was
not doing the TIMS3311 course). This was because they did not keep up
with the deadlines we had, and they dismissed requirements (e.g. APA
referencing). Start-ups need to move quickly, and I need to be able to
trust that work will be completed both on time and to a high standard. I
did not trust they could do this, so I unfortunately had to remove them
from the team. They did not respond to this well, but I knew it was the
right decision for the team.

Another challenge was work-life balance. Both my teammate and I have
very busy lives, in which project managing our progress became
difficult. However, I set recurring daily alarms to check in / reflect
on our progress which helped (I had to adjust it so it went off at a
time I could send a check in message).

## Personal Lessons

Through WIL, I learnt that I am a perfectionist (which may limit my
leadership capabilities). When my teammates work does not align with my
standards for a task, I am inclined to take over what I delegated to
them. However, this was partially due to my lack of communication. My
perfectionism may have also led me to initially not seek out teammates
for my TIMS3311 loneliness project, in which I put more work on myself
than necessary.

I have also realised that I have a lot to learn when it comes to
creating a start-up and the legal requirements involved in that process
(e.g. lodging tax returns). I am excited to continue learning and to get
a mentor that will guide me along the way.

## What I Would Do Differently

If I was to do WIL differently, I would have conducted interviews of my
potential teammates before onboarding them (to ensure role fit).

I would have sent clearer briefs to my teammates on what I’d like them
to complete and by when, including examples. I would have also done
bi-weekly messages asking (1) what they have completed, (2) what are
their roadblocks and (3) what are their next steps, to keep things
moving forward.

I would have formed more of a relationship with my other teammates
through social outings or casual chats. The rapport you have with your
team has an impact on their motivation and willingness to come to you
for support.

I would have also reflected more on my personal roadblocks beyond the
tasks itself (e.g. my new job occupying my attention or finding it hard
to delegate).

## Utilising the Start Up Ecosystem

I have not established new networks within the student team or start up
ecosystem. It will be beneficial to reach out to UQIES or UQ Ventures
team once we have a validated idea, as they can guide us on how we can
scale our solution. However, our team should have engaged more in those
ecosystems and networked, as those teams may have given us ideas on new
formats for our solution.

## Prior Knowledge / Skills vs Now

Prior to the TIMS3311 course, I had theoretical knowledge on
entrepreneurial concepts but had limited understanding on practical
implementation. I now understand the need to establish profit
expectations among teammates, set expectations regarding managerial
hierarchy, perform performance reviews or give feedback regularly,
create task briefs and regularly check in on how people are progressing.
I have also learnt that Stripe is a helpful platform to process online
payments (which we used for our MVP).

In terms of societally, I’ve learnt people prefer to provide criticism
on what’s been done, but do not necessarily offer solutions on how to do
things better. In application to our solution, people would prefer to
attend pre-planned activities, rather than having a session to plan
those activities with others.

## Understanding of Entrepreneurial Concepts

In terms of entrepreneurial concepts, I have learnt how to lead a team
through the lean start up process in a way that keeps things flexible
but structured. In our team, we focused on created and running and MVP
for 3 weeks. If the MVP failed, we would collect customer insight in the
last week to pivot or refine our idea. A similar format could be applied
to any agile business. I also learnt that ranking the customer jobs,
pains and gains when applying the Value Proposition Canvas allows you to
focus on what really matters to your target market (and develop a
solution accordingly).

I’ve learnt the value of the learn start up process to hypothesise a
solution that will work and actually prove or disprove that hypothesis.
It focuses your attention less on failing or succeeding, but rather
proving or disproving a hypothesis (more positive outlook).
Entrepreneurship is experimentation, and I hope to do this until I find
a successful solution to loneliness.

Through WIL, we used various entrepreneurial concepts (as we planned to
in our TIMS3311 presentation). If I was to re-do this course, I would
structure my entrepreneurial process like what is in Appendix B. We
generally followed that structure but we did rank jobs, pains and gains
or our solution ideas (step 4) and we did not ask all customer
development questions we planned on asking. Going forward, my team will
begin at Step 4 in Appendix B to effectively test our solution
hypothesis. I will apply this to my future roles as I would like to be
an entrepreneur in the loneliness space.

## Impact on Future Career Trajectory

The WIL experience definitely had an impact on my future career
trajectory. I want to be persistent in experimenting a solution to
loneliness that will help people. I also intend to work on my leadership
capabilities (e.g. perfectionism) so I can become a better leader. In my
TIMS3310 course, I was introduced to the leadership circle test
(Leadership Circle, 2025). I will regularly review my results and work
towards because a more creative, than reactive, leader.

## WIL Course Improvements

I valued the opportunity to create an actual start up in TIMS3311. While
we only made \$15 in revenue so far, it has given us the opportunity to
actually implement the entrepreneurial theories we learn at UQ. While
learning the theory is valuable, nothing compares to real life
experience in applying those concepts.

The WIL experience team can improve the course by sending weekly emails
for students to report on their progress and reflect on their learnings.
They could also include structured guidance on building a startup from
scratch (this is lacking across entrepreneurial courses at UQ).
Moreover, they could provide a ‘personal development’ aspect to the
course. Building and working on startups goes beyond a check list of
tasks. You need intrinsic motivation and leadership capabilities to
bring a vision to life.

## Digital Diary Entries

There was no place on blackboard to log digital diary entries. However,
I logged these on my own device as I progressed through the course. You
can see my entries in Appendix A.

# Appendix A

## ChatGPT Declaration

Please note: I used ChatGPT (ChatGPT, n.d.) to create these reflections
as the weeks went by. However, the ideas are original, ChatGPT just
summarised them and categorised them.

## July 31<sup>st</sup>

**WIL Placement Reflection Journal**

**Week 1 \| 31st July**

**1. What have I learnt about myself / personal lessons?**

It takes a significant amount of personal drive to get anywhere with
business-related tasks — especially when you're working alone in a team
without accountability. I tend to use business work as a way to avoid
other ‘must-do’ tasks. However, treating startup creation as a formal
course with deadlines has helped combat procrastination and actually
make progress.

**2. What did the experience mean to me?**

I spent time running through readings and trying to make them applicable
this semester. While it was complex and layered, I realised the
importance of acting quickly — doing background research and
conceptualising fast so I can get to pilot testing and genuinely start
helping people feel less lonely, sooner.

**3. What were the highlights?**

Rediscovering my passion for helping people with loneliness.

**4. What were the challenges? How did you deal with them?**

Starting with a concrete plan was tough — I was sick, managing family
matters, and returning from holiday. I overcame it by setting aside
specific blocks of time to focus and get things done.

**5. In hindsight, how would you have approached WIL differently?**

I wish I had approached the first lesson with more intention —
recognising it was a WIL course from the start. Being present for the
first class could have helped me form a team and gain early input from
teaching staff.

**6. Prior knowledge, experience and skill level compared to now?**

My knowledge and skills were relatively the same after doing the
readings, but I’ve now structured them into actionable steps that drive
real results. I especially value how the project incorporates creating
research questions and using methodology (like Lean Startup) to frame
and reflect on our work.

**7. Most important entrepreneurial concepts or theories? Why did they
stand out?**

- **Summarising insights**: The final step in Lean Startup taught me
  that capturing learning is key — not just for growth, but for building
  credibility.

- **Self stand-up meetings**: I plan to ask myself: *What have I done?
  What will I work on today? What are my roadblocks?*

- **Value Proposition Canvas**: Ranking customer jobs, pains, and gains
  by severity or relevance helps ensure I offer value where it really
  matters.

**8. Potential impact on future career trajectory?**

It’s taught me to create action plans with objectives and outcomes — and
to seek accountability in order to stay on track. This mindset applies
to any career goal I’ll pursue.

**9. Suggestions for WIL course improvement?**

Provide more support in turning readings into an actionable plan. If we
already knew how to do that, we wouldn’t be taking the course —
structured guidance could make a big difference.

## August 8<sup>th</sup>

**WIL Reflection Journal — Lean Startup MVP Action Plan**

*Date: 8 Aug 2025 (Brisbane)*

1.  **Experience I want to reflect on**

Making a plan of action for how I will get my MVP up and running, test
it, and work through the full Lean Startup process.

2.  **What have I learnt about myself / personal lessons?**

Planning lowers my stress, boosts my confidence, and makes success feel
achievable because I set clear objectives and a path to hit them.

3.  **What the experience meant to me**

It gave me clarity and focus so I know exactly how I’ll achieve what
I’ve set out to do.

4.  **The highlights**

Building a framework that summarises the startup process using the
theories I remember from my UQ entrepreneurship courses.

5.  **The challenges — and how I dealt with them**

I started a new job with high expectations around knowing the
business/product, which took time to ramp up and set systems. I adjusted
my plan to still meet my deadlines.

6.  **In hindsight, how would you have approached WIL differently?**

Nothing so far.

7.  **Prior knowledge, experience and skill level compared to now**

Before: I had pieces of theory but no cohesive process.

Now: I’ve combined what I’ve learned at UQ into a usable process to
pursue my main research objective: developing a profitable product or
service that effectively reduces loneliness among 18–24-year-olds in
South-East Queensland.

8.  **Most important entrepreneurial concepts/theories or skills
    (why/how they matter)**

Creating testable assumptions and designing MVPs (and iterations) to
test them—so I can continuously improve the product/service.

9.  **Potential impact on future career trajectory**

If this works, I could potentially run my business full time.

10. **Suggestions for improving the WIL experience/course**

Provide a pre-built process that integrates the entrepreneurship theory
to support placements. (Though creating my own was a valuable exercise.)

## August 19<sup>th</sup>

**1. Experience I want to reflect on**

Onboarding team members for my business stuff.

**2. What have I learnt about myself / personal lessons?**

That I tend to try to do things alone, even though there may be people
out there that are interested in the same topic as me and happy to help.

**3. What the experience meant to me**

Sometimes it’s worth trying to ask.

**4. The highlights**

Getting team members who are also passionate about the topic.

**5. The challenges & how I dealt with them**

Finding times everyone is available, but we ended up figuring out some
recurring meeting times just by discussing.

**6. In hindsight, how I would have approached WIL differently**

Tried to get teammates from week 1.

**7. Prior knowledge, experience, and skill level compared to now**

That when doing a startup, I need to think long term and also consider
expectations everyone would have surrounding profits and hierarchy, etc.

**8. Most important entrepreneurial concepts / theories learnt or skills
developed**

Links to effectuation — using networks and knowledge.

**9. Potential impact on future career trajectory & suggestions for WIL
team**

Potentially getting team members before I even have a startup concept in
the future (I had never thought about this before).

## September 22<sup>nd</sup> 

**1. Experience I want to reflect on**

I had to fire a team member. They were not technically part of the
course but were helping me and another team member with the project.

**2. What have I learnt about myself / personal lessons?**

I learnt that it is not easy to make the decision to let people go, and
you will get backlash from them regardless. My reasons for firing them
included timeliness of work, lack of attention to requirements, and not
meeting standards. Their response burnt a bridge for them to have a role
at Something Someday in the future. I also learnt that I should have
done this project on my own, as getting others involved slowed down the
process. However, I do think people can be helpful for marketing and
spreading the word.

**3. What the experience meant to me?**

It stung a little, but it helped me realise how companies can get
frustrated with their employees — especially juniors who don’t know the
business well.

**4. The highlights?**

It was a negative highlight, but it showed me what leadership does not
look like. The problem was that this person did not possess leadership
qualities themselves and was mostly critiquing me. They had passion for
the project, but they did not see it as a business or give it the
professionalism and work standard it deserves.

**5. The challenges? How did you deal with it?**

The challenge was ending the agreement professionally. I handled it by
writing a clear message: thanking them for their contributions,
outlining the issues (timeliness, attention to requirements, standards),
and explaining why I couldn’t continue the agreement. I acknowledged
their strengths in psychology and invited them to consider where their
skills might align for a different role in the future.

**6. In hindsight, how would you have approached WIL differently?**

I would have approached this task alone and made it clear that if I
brought anyone on board, it would mainly be for marketing support.

**7. Prior knowledge, experience and skill level compared to now?**

I should have interviewed the team members I brought on board. At the
time, I didn’t think to do this because I was excited about having
people join. Now I understand the frustrations companies face with new
hires and why training or explaining the business is important for
context.

**8. Most important entrepreneurial concepts or theories that I learnt /
skills developed**

The importance of building a good entrepreneurial team. This stood out
because the wrong fit slowed the project and created unnecessary
challenges. In future, I’ll be more intentional in selecting and
onboarding people.

**9. Potential impact of WIL on my future career trajectory**

It showed me that my passion for this area makes me a good fit for
entrepreneurship, but also revealed where I lack skills (e.g.,
marketing). This motivates me to keep developing those areas to become
more well-rounded.

## September 29<sup>th</sup>

**1. Experience I want to reflect on**

No real communication between my teammate and myself, and not checking
in on each other’s progress.

**2. What have I learnt about myself / personal lessons?**

I need to check in with my teammates more, ask more questions (like what
is their strategy), and make expectations clear.

**3. What the experience meant to me**

Made me feel annoyed at the lack of communication, like I was telling
Yuumi she’d done nothing when really she just hadn’t communicated what
she had done.

**4. The highlights**

Recognising I need to be communicating with her more.

**5. The challenges and how I dealt with them**

I raised concerns about workload and registrations, which led to an
honest but defensive response from Yuumi. I clarified that while I
appreciated her work, the lack of communication meant I didn’t know what
she was doing. I suggested we improve by planning ahead and
communicating more clearly.

**6. In hindsight, how I would have approached WIL differently**

Check in daily.

**7. Prior knowledge, experience, and skill level compared to now**

I now see the importance of setting weekly expectations and checking in
regularly.

**8. Most important entrepreneurial concepts or theories learnt / skills
developed**

- **Lean Startup Methodology** – Showed me the importance of starting
  small and testing quickly rather than waiting for “perfect.”

- **Agile & Iterative Workflows** – Helped me see the value of breaking
  projects down and adapting as I go.

- **Resilience & Adaptability** – Taught me to handle team conflict and
  uncertainty with professionalism and persistence.

These stood out because they directly applied to the challenges I faced
in WIL and are transferable to future roles.

**9. Potential impact on my future career trajectory**

Potentially that I may enjoy running my teams in person so I can
actually see the progress everyone is making.

**10. Suggestions on how the WIL experience team can improve the
course**

Have check-ins with the teams running their own startups. Send us a
weekly Google Form to track progress, so we don’t need to self-manage
reflections and risk forgetting them.

## October 13<sup>th</sup>

**WIL Reflection Journal**

**1. Experience I want to reflect on**

Survey responses for why our first solution didn’t work and what might
work better.

**2. What have I learnt about myself / personal lessons?**

Everyone will have thoughts on your business or may not want to give you
solutions at all. The people who face the problem will provide ideas to
help you help them.

**3. What the experience meant to me**

It was just collecting ideas.

**4. The highlights**

Finding out ideas to make a better solution:

• Stick to 18–24 year olds for now, but 34–54 year olds could also be a
receptive target market.

• Organise low-effort, low-commitment social activities instead of
planning sessions.

• People already have busy schedules.

• Clearer messaging about the experience and value.

• People fear awkwardness or gender imbalance.

• True friendships form around shared interests or common goals, not
arbitrary age groups.

• Matching people based on life stage or interests could improve
outcomes.

• Prefer fun, themed, challenge-based, or game-oriented events.

• Combine casual fun with deeper meaning.

• Consistency and structure (regular meetups or check-ins) make
friendships stick.

• People want to bond through shared purpose.

• People want light facilitation at first (guided conversations,
question cards, small groups), then gradual independence.

• People prefer a hybrid approach: real-world connection with optional
digital support.

• Participants value flexibility — e.g., “Grabbing coffee in 20 mins” or
“Park walk this afternoon.”

• Some suggested short courses on communication, confidence, or
boundaries to help users connect better.

**5. The challenges & how I dealt with them**

Struggled to get enough responses, so I DM’d my network and made
Facebook posts about it.

**6. In hindsight, how would you have approached WIL differently?**

I wish we did more in-person events to reflect how people naturally form
friendships.

**7. Prior knowledge, experience, and skill level compared to now**

I’ve learned that people want pre-planned activities — they don’t want
to be the planners since it takes effort and coordination.

**8. Most important entrepreneurial concepts or theories learnt**

Pivoting an idea based on feedback (hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship).

This stood out because it showed me the value of listening to users and
iterating quickly — something I’ll apply in all future entrepreneurial
and project-based roles.

**9. Potential impact on future career trajectory**

Hopefully, it gets us closer to developing an actual successful product
or service.

**10. Suggestions for how the WIL team could improve the course**

Nothing comes to mind.
