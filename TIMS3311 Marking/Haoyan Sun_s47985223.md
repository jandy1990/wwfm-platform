**1. Overall WIL Experience  **
  
**Personal Lessons**

Joining the AloeVITA project was my first experience applying
entrepreneurial frameworks in a real-world setting. I was excited by the
originality of a sparkling aloe beverage, but also uncertain about its
market position. Early on, I realised that entrepreneurship isn’t about
certainty—it’s about learning through structured exploration.

Ambiguity quickly became our reality. The founder had a broad vision,
and our team had to translate that into something specific. This
initially frustrated me—I realised that I struggled to make confident
decisions under uncertainty and often second-guessed early design
choices. I learned that I tend to over-focus on “getting it right,”
which slowed down execution. Working with team members helped me reframe
decisions as learning steps rather than final answers. Effectuation’s
“Crazy Quilt” principle shifted my mindset: instead of waiting for
perfect plans, we leaned on what we had—our team, our networks, and
campus users—to co-create value step-by-step.

A major turning point came during Assessment 1 when our lecturer said:
“Don't just ask—build something and see how people react.” This deeply
influenced our research design. We embedded visuals into surveys, tested
mock packaging and message tiles in interviews, and sought real
behavioural signals instead of relying on opinions. I learned that
credible validation comes when users choose, click, taste, or ask for
more—not just when they say they like something.

We faced setbacks too. Survey response rates were initially poor. To fix
this, we printed QR codes and distributed them to students in long
queues during UQ Uninight events. It worked. Interview opt-ins from the
survey converted poorly, so we pivoted: reaching out to female peers and
using social media to find wellness-minded respondents. If I could start
again, I would plan multi-channel recruitment earlier. Overall, I
discovered both my design limitations and growing adaptability—key
insights for future innovation work.

## Networks Established

## One of the most valuable outcomes of this WIL experience was building genuine networks, both within and beyond the classroom. Working with Leah, the AloeVITA founder, gave me direct insight into the founder’s mindset: optimistic, resourceful, yet always under pressure to validate quickly. I also learned a great deal from my teammates, each bringing different strengths in data, design, and storytelling. Together we developed a rhythm of feedback and iteration that made us feel like a real startup team rather than a student group.  Beyond our immediate project, I connected with mentors from UQ Ventures and other students conducting lean experiments. These exchanges showed me that everyone struggles with uncertainty, but those who keep testing learn the fastest. These connections have continued beyond the course and have already become a small peer community where we share startup progress and feedback.  **2. New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills**  **The Past: My Starting Point**

## Before this course, my understanding of entrepreneurship was mostly rooted in theory. As a Marketing and Innovation major, I was familiar with concepts like value propositions, segmentation, and customer journey mapping. However, I had never applied tools like empathy maps, “How Might We” framing, or Journey Mapping outside the classroom. I often viewed innovation as a creative exercise rather than a structured, iterative process.

Although I had completed two prior internships—one at a well-established
marketing agency and another at a traditional bank—both environments
were already structured and stable. I never had the chance to apply
entrepreneurial frameworks in uncertain or fast-changing contexts until
now.

##  Key Learnings 

### Lean Startup: Testing beats talking

### The Build–Measure–Learn loop became our guiding structure. After using Design Thinking to build empathy, we moved into systematic validation with Lean Startup tools to transform insights into experiments (Bocken & Snihur, 2019). We started with a Business Model Environmental Map to understand the broader beverage landscape in Australia, including health trends, sustainability expectations, and distribution constraints. We then ran Problem Interviews with potential consumers to confirm that the need for a refreshing, low-sugar, natural option exists without pitching our solution.  Once we had confidence in the problem space, we filled a Business Model Canvas, focusing first on Customer Segments and Value Proposition, and treating each block as a hypothesis to test. To validate these assumptions in-market, we created a lightweight MVP in the form of landing pages that compared three value propositions: “Healthy Fizz,” “Beauty Glow,” and “Australian Organic Sparkle.” We measured clicks and sign-ups as behavioural signals. Consistent with our interviews, the health-led message outperformed the beauty-only language. This taught me that user behaviour, not stated preference, provides the most reliable evidence.  Because our lecturer emphasised testing with artefacts, we embedded concrete stimuli throughout. In the survey, we used concise message tiles instead of abstract opinion questions. In interviews, we showed mock labels, shelf photos (water aisle vs collagen products), and slogan cards. Participants made visible choices and then explained why. This shift from opinion-seeking to choice-eliciting produced clearer signals for iteration.  We also learned that small samples and concrete visuals travel better than long explanations when recruiting; pairing on-campus QR codes with short prompts worked, while email follow-ups from the survey did not. I now treat weak signals as instructions for the next iteration, not reasons to defend an old idea.  

### Design Thinking: Empathy before assumptions

### Design Thinking changed how I approach problems. Instead of asking, “What should we sell?”, I began to ask, “What do people actually care about?” Early in the project we built an Empathy Map to visualise how potential customers think, feel, see, and do in their daily routines. I learned that the earlier this tool is used, the more valuable it becomes for the founder, because it aligns everyone around real human context before any solutions are designed. It also helps prevent costly misalignment later. Designing the consumer survey and the empathy interviews pushed us to explore not only demographics but emotional triggers and real-world situations (McDonagh, 2006). Through this process, we discovered that people associate aloe with hydration and skin health, yet their purchasing decisions are more influenced by low sugar and clean ingredients than by overt beauty claims. The Empathy Map made these insights tangible and easier to communicate to the founder.  

### Effectuation: Working with what you have

### The principles of Affordable Loss and Crazy Quilt encouraged us to act resourcefully. With no budget for full-scale trials, we relied on fake-door and smoke tests to measure interest before production (Ortega et al., 2017). We used partnerships, campus events, and peer networks to recruit participants. Innovation felt more practical and accessible once I accepted that progress depends on small, deliberate actions with the resources you already have.  The Future: Career Impact

This WIL experience has significantly influenced how I view my future
career. I used to imagine working in marketing or product management
within large, structured organisations. Now, I am drawn to roles at the
intersection of research and innovation, such as product strategy,
consumer insight, or venture incubation. I enjoy turning ambiguity into
clarity, taking raw ideas, testing them, and translating them into
validated insights. Designing surveys, conducting empathy interviews,
and analysing behavioural responses strengthened both my analytical and
communication skills. In future roles, I want to continue making
decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions.  
  
The project also gave me confidence in working with founders and
handling uncertainty. I realised that I can move forward even when
information is incomplete, as long as I keep testing and learning. That
adaptability is one of the most valuable entrepreneurial skills I have
developed.  
  
**3. Course Feedback  **
  
**What I Valued Most**

What I appreciated most about this course was how effectively it
integrated theory with practice. We did not just learn frameworks; we
lived them. Each week felt like an iteration, moving from defining
problems to testing and refining solutions. The course design encouraged
experimentation, and the feedback sessions helped me reflect and improve
continuously. I valued the teaching approach that emphasised critical
thinking over fixed answers. It mirrored real entrepreneurial learning,
where guidance is about framing better questions rather than providing
solutions.  
  
**Suggestions for Improvement**

1\. Earlier interaction with founders. Meeting Leah halfway through the
semester was valuable, but engaging with multiple founders at the
beginning would help students select projects that fit their skills and
interests.  
2. More applied research training. Many of us struggled with designing
unbiased surveys, coding qualitative interviews, and recruiting
consistently. A short workshop on these skills, including low-cost
sample-boosting tactics like campus QR distribution, would strengthen
data quality.  
3. Structured reflection checkpoints. Encouraging students to record
brief reflections throughout the semester would make learning more
authentic and less retrospective. It would also help students
internalise entrepreneurial thinking as a continuous process rather than
an end-of-semester task.  
  
**4. Conclusion**

This WIL experience transformed how I understand entrepreneurship. The
AloeVITA project was not only about developing a product; it was about
learning how to think, test, and adapt like an entrepreneur. I entered
the semester believing that innovation was about ideas. I am leaving it
knowing that innovation is built on empathy, evidence, and iteration.  
  
Through Design Thinking, I learned to see the world through customers’
eyes. Through Lean Startup, I learned to learn faster and act sooner by
testing artefacts, not just asking for opinions. Through Effectuation, I
learned that meaningful ventures often begin with what is already at
hand. These lessons have reshaped my mindset and clarified my career
aspirations.  
  
Most importantly, I learned that reflection itself is part of
innovation. Every mistake, pivot, and insight was not just an outcome
but a lesson in how to build something that genuinely matters.

# 6. Five reflective diary entries

**  **
Diary Entry 1 – Choosing the AloeVITA Project (15 August)

When I first had to choose a project for my WIL placement, I felt both
curious and uncertain. There were several directions available, but the
AloeVITA project stood out because it wasn’t just a business idea — it
was an opportunity to build something from the ground up. A natural
sparkling aloe beverage felt unique in the Australian market, and I was
intrigued by how it connected health, sustainability, and
entrepreneurship.

At that stage, we had almost no data, only a founder’s vision and a few
assumptions about what customers might want. I realised that committing
to AloeVITA meant entering a high-uncertainty space, but that also made
it more meaningful. I drew on Effectuation theory, especially the “Crazy
Quilt” principle — instead of waiting for perfect information, I decided
to partner, learn, and co-create with the founder and my teammates. We
agreed to treat the project as a live experiment rather than a fixed
plan.

Through this decision, I learned to be more comfortable with ambiguity.
Instead of seeing uncertainty as a weakness, I started to see it as a
creative space where collaboration and iteration matter more than
perfection. This mindset shift was important because it helped me enter
the project with curiosity instead of fear, and it laid the foundation
for applying Design Thinking and Lean Startup later in the process.

Diary Entry 2 – Preparing Assessment 1 (Aug 18)

During the preparation for our first group presentation, “Aloe Beverage
Market Validation,” our biggest challenge was turning an abstract idea
into a structured, evidence-based plan. We began with uncertainty —
should AloeVITA be a functional health drink or a beauty drink? The
founder’s vision was inspiring, but we needed a framework to transform
it into actionable hypotheses.

We applied Design Thinking to reframe our questions around empathy: Who
are our users? What problem are we solving for them? This helped us move
away from assumptions and focus on real consumer needs. Then, using Lean
Startup, we translated those insights into experiments — identifying
what to test first, such as packaging, positioning, and usage occasions.

Working on the presentation required deep collaboration. Each teammate
contributed different skills: data analysis, storytelling, and design.
Through multiple iterations, I realised how valuable feedback loops are
— every critique refined our thinking. I also learned to manage
ambiguity by setting short-term validation goals instead of trying to
solve everything at once.

This experience showed me how theory can guide practice. Design Thinking
helped us empathise with potential customers, and Lean Startup gave us
discipline to test instead of guess. It was the first time I felt like a
student project could operate like a real startup — learning through
structured uncertainty.

Diary Entry 3 – Designing the Survey (from September 3)

Designing the AloeVITA consumer survey was my first real attempt to
apply entrepreneurial theory to practice. After finalising our
positioning ideas in the first presentation, we realised that we were
still making too many assumptions — about who our customers were, what
they valued, and why they would buy an aloe beverage. To move forward,
we needed evidence, not intuition.

We used the Lean Startup principle of Build–Measure–Learn: building a
simple test (the survey), measuring reactions, and learning which
direction to pursue. Translating abstract ideas into clear, unbiased
questions was harder than expected. I had to think carefully about
phrasing to avoid leading answers and to capture both rational and
emotional drivers — whether people saw AloeVITA as a health drink or a
beauty drink.

This process also deepened my understanding of Design Thinking. By
focusing on empathy, we tried to step into the consumer’s mindset —
imagining their daily habits, purchase contexts, and what “healthy” or
“beauty” meant to them. I learned that good questions are not about
proving our ideas right, but about discovering what we might be missing.

The experience taught me to be more hypothesis-driven and analytical. It
was satisfying to see how a structured approach to data collection could
bring clarity to something as fuzzy as “consumer perception.” For the
first time, I felt that research wasn’t just an academic exercise — it
was a real tool for entrepreneurial learning.

Diary Entry 4 – From Survey Results to Interview Design (October 13)

When we received the results from our 52 survey responses, the data
challenged almost everything we had assumed. We initially thought that
consumers would be drawn to AloeVITA for its beauty and skin-health
benefits. However, the survey revealed that most people were actually
motivated by health-related attributes — “low sugar,” “clean
ingredients,” and “organic.” The “beauty” idea appealed emotionally but
lacked credibility on its own.

This was a turning point. I realised that entrepreneurship is not about
defending your first idea — it’s about listening, adapting, and
iterating. We decided to use the insights as a bridge to qualitative
exploration. With Design Thinking, we re-entered the empathy stage,
asking: “Why do people trust some messages more than others?” and “What
does ‘healthy but beautiful’ mean to them in real life?”

We redesigned our interview questions to test these nuances — focusing
on how shelf placement, packaging, and emotional triggers influence
perception. This shift felt like a Lean Startup pivot: we weren’t
abandoning our vision but refining it with evidence.

Through this stage, I learned the importance of humility in innovation.
Real learning happens when you let go of your biases and let the data
reshape your story. It also strengthened my belief that Design Thinking
and Lean Startup are not separate tools but complementary mindsets — one
builds empathy, the other enforces discipline.

Diary Entry 5 – Conducting the Interviews (Mid–Late October)

Conducting the interviews was one of the most eye-opening parts of this
project. After analysing the survey, we wanted to go deeper — to
understand not just what people preferred, but why they felt that way.
Talking directly with participants made me realise how complex consumer
perception really is. Many shared similar thoughts about wanting
something “refreshing, low-sugar, and natural,” yet their emotional
reactions varied widely depending on how we described the product.

Some interviewees instantly connected with the idea of “glow from
within” and saw it as empowering, while others felt cautious, worrying
that beauty claims might sound like empty marketing. I didn’t expect
such strong opinions about wording and trust — it made me appreciate the
importance of empathy and careful framing in early-stage branding.

What surprised me most was how environment shaped perception.
Participants told us that where a drink appears on the shelf — next to
water or next to beauty drinks — completely changes how they interpret
it. These insights reminded me that consumer understanding goes far
beyond product features; it’s also about context, cues, and story.

Through this process, I felt Design Thinking in action. Empathy
interviews weren’t just data collection — they were a dialogue that
shaped our next experiments. It also showed me how humility and
curiosity drive innovation more than assumptions ever could.
