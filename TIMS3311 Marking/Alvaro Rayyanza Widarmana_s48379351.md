Introduction

In the TIMS3311 course, I worked with Eclipse Ingredients, a biotech startup developing a
Series A funding strategy. Beyond research, I focused on teamwork, communication, and
adaptability. Applying Lean Startup, Design Thinking, and Effectuation helped me navigate
uncertainty, manage challenges, and reflect on how collaboration and persistence shape real
entrepreneurial growth.

Overall WIL Experience (8 marks)


Personal lessons (5 marks):

During my placement with Eclipse Ingredients, one of my biggest learning curves was
understanding how essential collaboration and networking are in a project environment.
While our main task focused on developing Eclipse’s Series A funding strategy, the deeper
challenge for me was learning how to work effectively with people both within my team and
across the broader professional network.

From the very beginning, Jack, our course coordinator, reminded us that this experience was
not only about research but also about building relationships. I saw the truth of that during
Eclipse’s industry event. Engaging in these conversations helped me realise that networking
is not just about introducing yourself, but about maintaining curiosity and empathy, learning
how others think, work, and solve problems. I also reconnected with my former boss, which
reminded me of the value of maintaining long-term professional relationships. Each
interaction helped me understand that good networking stems from genuine communication
rather than self-interest.

However, the most difficult part of this project came from within my own team. We were five
people, but at times it felt like I was working alone. Some teammates were inconsistent,
others unmotivated, and communication was almost non-existent. There were weeks where
no one replied to messages or followed through with their assigned work. I found myself
constantly creating new systems and plans to get everyone back on track trying to reignite
momentum that never quite lasted. It was frustrating because I cared deeply about the
outcome and wanted the project to reflect our collective effort, not just mine.

Looking back, I realise I spent more time trying to make the team work than trying to make
the project work. I believed that if everyone contributed equally, our results would improve.
                                                                                                3

But in reality, sometimes leadership means accepting that balance isn’t always possible. My
“pie” analogy from Appendix 5 reflects this: I started by giving 10% of effort expecting
everyone else to give the same, but when progress stalled, now I realised I needed to give 30,
40, or even 50% just to keep things moving.

In hindsight, I would focus less on expecting equal contribution and more on delivering
consistent progress, even if it meant carrying extra weight. This experience taught me that
teamwork is not about equality of effort, but about shared accountability and sometimes,
leading means working harder than everyone else.


Network Established (3 Marks)

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to connect with several professionals who
expanded my understanding of both finance and the startup ecosystem. I reconnected with my
former internship supervisor, Firmansyah Shidiq, who works in Islamic finance. Despite my
poor performance during that internship, rebuilding that relationship taught me humility and
the importance of maintaining professionalism and long-term respect. I also interviewed
Khalif Putra, a finance professional, and soon Adam Smith, a Senior Associate at FaBA,
whose insights will be focused on commercialisation and investment.

Working closely with Siobhan, Eclipse’s founder, also helped me experience how leadership,
research, and business intersect. Visiting her lab at QUT gave me a chance to meet scientists
and see firsthand how collaboration drives innovation. I also attended one of Eclipse’s
industry events in Brisbane, where I met several professionals from the startup sectors.

Although my network remains small, these connections are genuine. I learned that
meaningful networking isn’t about quantity but consistency showing up to meetings,
following up, and keeping relationships alive through curiosity, respect, and shared purpose.


New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills (16 marks)

Key Learnings (9 marks)

The two most important lessons I gained from this experience were learning how to apply the
Lean Startup model, empathy from Design Thinking, and Effectuation principles in real,
                                                                                              4

uncertain situations. These frameworks became more than just theories; they shaped the way
I approached teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership during the Eclipse project.

The Lean Startup model stood out most because it perfectly reflected my process of constant
experimentation within the team. When my teammates rarely responded to my messages or
meeting polls, I found myself continuously creating new structures and systems to encourage
engagement. I would design a new plan, test it, observe the results, and then rebuild another
approach when it didn’t work. Looking back, this mirrored the Build–Measure–Learn cycle
treating each attempt as feedback rather than failure. It taught me that progress in both
startups and teamwork doesn’t come from one perfect system but from continuously adapting
and improving. This mindset also influenced how I handled research: testing different
methods such as using Crunchbase, ChatGPT, or manual Google searches to find the most
efficient and accurate investor data. These small iterations helped me learn how to identify
what works best and where to focus effort skills that are fundamental to innovation.

Empathy, a core element of Design Thinking, also became crucial throughout this project. I
applied it not just toward customers or stakeholders, but toward my own teammates. When
Ryan suddenly decided to step up as leader despite not contributing earlier, I initially felt
frustrated and doubtful. However, when I tried to understand his perspective, I realised that
taking on that role might have been his way of feeling accountable and motivated. That
moment helped me understand that everyone has different triggers for engagement, and that
leadership is not about control, it’s about creating space for others to contribute in their own
way. Without that empathy, I would have reacted emotionally instead of constructively, which
would have made collaboration even harder.

Lastly, Effectuation helped me focus on what I could control instead of what I couldn’t. There
were times when I felt demotivated by the team’s inconsistency, but the “Pilot-in-the-Plane”
and “Affordable Loss” principles reminded me to use the resources and energy I already had,
rather than waiting for ideal conditions. I realised that progress doesn’t depend on others’
readiness but on how I respond to challenges with what’s available.


The Future (4 marks)

This course has deeply influenced how I think about entrepreneurship and teamwork. It
showed me that no venture succeeds in isolation as teamwork and networking are the
                                                                                               5

foundation of any business. As I experienced through this project, even with my best efforts,
completing a task alone is difficult. Every entrepreneur eventually works with people, and
success depends on how well you can align a team’s different goals, personalities, and
motivations toward one shared objective. Learning to lead through uncertainty, stay patient,
and communicate clearly became just as important as the research itself.

This project also gave me a glimpse into what working in a startup actually looks like.
Visiting Siobhan’s lab and observing her and her team in action showed me how
experimentation, iteration, and resilience drive innovation. Seeing the Lean Startup mindset
applied in real life made the process feel tangible and gave me a clearer picture of the
environment I want to be part of in the future. I now feel more confident stepping into
uncertain spaces, knowing that adaptability, empathy, and teamwork are the true foundations
of entrepreneurial success.


Course Feedback (3 marks)

What I valued most about this course was the freedom to approach problems creatively and
apply theories in a real-world context. It provided a soft, real-life experience, a space where I
could make mistakes, learn from them, and build confidence in the process. This course felt
like a simulation of a workplace: you either treat it seriously and see how you perform under
real conditions, or you treat it as just another assignment. I chose to approach it as if I were
already part of a company team. Even though our project did not fully succeed, I see it as a
personal success because it helped me understand how I respond to failure and uncertainty in
a professional setting. It gave me a chance to test my mindset, emotional control, and
adaptability without the real-world risks.

However, I think the course could be improved in three areas. First, the structure relies
heavily on group motivation, if a team is unresponsive, the experience becomes discouraging.
There should be an anonymous channel or “open-report” system for students to raise
concerns or request support early. Second, team leaders should report fortnightly to Jack or
tutors to show progress and ensure accountability within the group. Third, assessment should
better reflect actual performance in the placement, not just written reflections. The current
grading system overlooks effort, initiative, and contribution during the internship, which feels
inconsistent with the course’s experiential focus.
                                                                                         6

Overall, the course gave me a realistic yet forgiving environment to grow a soft entry into
how work and leadership operate in real life.

   1.​ Appendix 1 - Reflective Diary Entry - Leadership Change and Accountability
       (Effectuation – Pilot-in-the-Plane):

During week 4, when Ryan suddenly asked to become the team leader, I was honestly
confused. Up until that point, he had not been active, and I was the one giving direction,
dividing tasks, and ensuring progress. The team’s slow responses and lack of motivation had
already drained me, so when he volunteered, I wasn’t sure if it would help or make things
worse. Still, I decided to step back and give him the opportunity. Surprisingly, this shift
turned out to be a positive one. Having Ryan in a leadership role created a sense of shared
accountability he began putting in work on research and checking progress, which made me
feel less isolated. It also gave the rest of the group someone else to look to for guidance,
which improved overall momentum, even if slightly.

This experience taught me that leadership isn’t always about being the one in charge;
sometimes it’s about knowing when to share control. Applying the Effectuation principle of
“Pilot-in-the-Plane,” I focused on what I could influence rather than forcing outcomes. By
empowering Ryan, I shifted from working alone to working alongside someone equally
responsible for results. It reminded me that entrepreneurship, much like teamwork, relies on
flexibility and co-creation progress happens when accountability is distributed, not when one
person tries to do everything alone.

   2.​ Appendix 2 - Reflective Diary Entry – Adapting Team Methods and Motivation (Lean
       Startup):

Throughout the project, I found myself constantly changing the way we worked because no
method seemed to stick. Early on, I created a detailed research methodology for the team to
follow, but no one applied it. I tried simplifying the steps showing exactly how to collect and
document investor data but the team still didn’t follow through. Frustrated, I decided to
divide the workload based on strengths: Michelle and I focused on the European strategy,
Ryan continued with research, and Yue Chen handled interviews. Even then, progress stayed
inconsistent.

Looking back, this constant cycle of trying, failing, and readjusting reflects the Lean Startup
“Build–Measure–Learn” principle. Each method I introduced was like an experiment, I built
                                                                                              9

a system, observed how it performed, learned from the outcome, and then pivoted to a new
approach. It was tiring and often discouraging, but I began to realise that failure is feedback.
Every time something didn’t work, it taught me more about how people respond to
responsibility, communication, and structure.

This experience showed me that teamwork, like entrepreneurship, is inherently iterative.
There’s rarely a perfect process; progress depends on adapting to the situation and learning
from what doesn’t work. Although it was frustrating to keep restarting, I learned resilience,
patience, and how to manage expectations when leading others. Most importantly, I learned
that experimentation doesn’t only apply to products or research, it also applies to people and
collaboration.




   3.​ Appendix 3 - Reflective Diary Entry – Interview Challenges and Learning
       Consistency (Lean Startup & Effectuation)

When it came to interviews, I struggled with consistency and motivation. Initially, I only
wanted to interview “qualified” people such as venture capitalists and professionals deeply
involved in startup funding. I thought targeting these high-value individuals would give the
project more credibility. However, I quickly realised how difficult it was to get responses
from busy investors. Weeks passed with little progress, and I began to lose momentum. I
ended up limiting my outreach to people within my own circle, which felt easier but less
impactful.

Looking back, I realise I approached this task with a perfectionist mindset rather than an
experimental one. If I had applied the Lean Startup “Build–Measure–Learn” principle earlier,
I would have treated interviews as iterations, starting small, learning from early
conversations, and refining my approach over time instead of waiting for the “ideal”
interviewee. I also see how the Effectuation principle of “Affordable Loss” could have
guided me: starting with the resources and connections I already had, rather than chasing
unreachable ones.

   4.​ Appendix 4 - Reflective Diary Entry – Dealing with Silence and Practicing Empathy
       (Design Thinking)
                                                                                              10

Throughout the project, one of the hardest challenges I faced was being consistently ignored
by my team. There were times when I would send reminders, create polls, or try to organise
meetings, and no one would reply. After putting in so much effort, the silence became
discouraging. I reached a point where I felt mentally exhausted and frustrated, questioning
why I cared so much when others didn’t seem to. It started to affect my motivation, and I
realised I needed to find a healthier way to process it.

That’s when I began applying Design Thinking’s empathy principle not just toward external
stakeholders, but toward my own team. I tried to put myself in their position and understand
why they might not be as responsive: everyone had different workloads, stress levels, and
priorities. Seeing things from their perspective didn’t excuse the lack of communication, but
it helped me stay calm and think positively. Instead of reacting out of frustration, I focused on
what I could control instead.

This mindset shift reminded me that empathy is not weakness; it’s a skill that helps sustain
collaboration even when conditions aren’t ideal. I learned that working with people means
accepting that not everyone operates the same way, and sometimes, the best way to lead is to
stay patient and steady. By choosing to think empathetically instead of emotionally, I was
able to keep myself focused and grounded, which ultimately helped me maintain my
commitment to the project.

   5.​ Appendix 5 - Diary Entry – Eclipse Reflection (Teamwork and the Pie Analogy)

Throughout my Eclipse journey, I’ve realized that teamwork is rarely equal, even if it looks
that way on paper. At the start, I imagined our group as five people, five equal slices, each
person contributing 20% to make the full circle. But as the project went on, I learned that real
teamwork doesn’t work that way. Some people contribute more, some less, and the balance
constantly shifts.

There were moments where I started by putting in about 10% of the work, assuming everyone
else would follow through with theirs. But when I noticed progress slowing down and others
not taking as much initiative, I had to rethink my role. I realized that sometimes you need to
give 30%, 40%, or even 60% not because you want to do everything, but because someone
has to keep the momentum going.
                                                                                          11

This experience taught me that leadership isn’t about dividing work equally; it’s about
ensuring the whole pie gets completed. Even if others contribute smaller slices, the project
still needs to move forward. At times, that meant doing more than I initially planned, but it
also taught me patience, responsibility, and the importance of leading by example.

In the end, the Eclipse project helped me understand that contribution is not about equality
it’s about commitment. Every slice matters, no matter how uneven, as long as the team
achieves the goal together.
