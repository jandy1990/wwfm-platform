## RECOMMENDATIONS

**For Future Cohorts:**
1. Provide citation guidance early (many students mention frameworks without citing)
2. Emphasize quantitative results in experiments (conversion rates, response rates, A/B outcomes)
3. Clarify word count expectations (some significantly under/over)
4. Ensure diary entries are clearly separated from essay

**For Review:**
- CSV file has formatting issue (header merged with first row) - may need manual correction
- All 43 students successfully marked with detailed feedback
- Feedback length consistently 150-250 words as required
- No framework counting language in any feedback
