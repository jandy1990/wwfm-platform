**Introduction**

This semester's WIL course was a very special experience for me. Our
group chose the project "Aloe Vita" - a healthy carbonated beverage with
a main ingredient of aloe vita. During the entire process, we were
required not only to analyse the market, research the users, and
presentations such as a startup team, but also to create questionnaires
and do interviews to confirm that our ideas were viable. The course
helped me realize the first time I have gone through the “theory to
practice” part, it also gave me the lessons on how to communicate,
divide tasks, and resolve issues in a team. Next, I will take my own
reflections about what I have learned and the obstacles I had to face
and how it has changed my future career path.

**My Overall WIL Experience**

For me, the entire WIL project was a very special learning experience.
Before, when attending classes, my understanding of entrepreneurship was
mostly at the theoretical level. I always thought that as long as you
had a good idea and made a nice business plan, you could be considered
as "starting a business". But when I actually started to participate in
the real project of Aloe Vita, I realized that from an idea to entering
the market, an enterprise is a long and complex process that requires
continuous testing, adjustment, and improvement.

At first, we thought the concept of aloe vita bubble drink was very
creative. But soon we realized that reality was much more difficult than
we had imagined. The biggest challenge was the market acceptance. Many
Australian consumers were not familiar with the concept of "aloe vita
drink", and some even thought that "aloe vita is something for applying
on the face, not for drinking". To understand the real market response,
our team first designed a questionnaire and then conducted several
interviews to explore consumers' attitudes towards "healthy" and
"beauty" drinks. This was the first time that I truly understood what it
meant to enter the market - the data was not copied from books, but was
"asked" out bit by bit by us.

In team collaboration, I also learned a lot. Each member has different
ways of thinking and areas of expertise. Some are good at analysis, some
are better at storytelling, and some have great ideas in design. At the
beginning, we had disagreements in our opinions, but after several
in-depth discussions, I learned to listen and realized that "one
person's idea is never enough". The diversity of the team is the key to
the progress of the project. More importantly, I understood that relying
solely on the ideas in one's mind is not enough; one must constantly
act, test, and adjust to turn those ideas into reality.

This period has broadened my understanding of entrepreneurship.
Especially at a startup forum, we also met the founder of Aloe Vita.
Hearing them talk about the difficulties in the early stages of
entrepreneurship, such as failed taste tests, returned packaging, and
restrictions from regulations, I truly felt that "execution" is far more
important than "creativity". That exchange made me deeply understand
that a company can persist because they keep learning and constantly
improving.

This WIL experience has transformed me from merely "observing
entrepreneurship" to "experiencing entrepreneurship". I have learned how
to analyze problems, validate ideas, and also how to communicate with
the team, users, and even entrepreneurs. More importantly, I have come
to believe that as long as one is willing to act, listen, and improve,
any good idea can gradually turn into reality.

**New knowledge, insights and practical skills**

Before taking this WIL course, my understanding of entrepreneurship and
innovation was rather limited. At that time, I was more focused on the
theoretical aspects and only knew some concepts from books, such as the
MVP model (Minimum Viable Product), and I also understood that
"entrepreneurship involves validating ideas", but I didn't know exactly
how to do it. For me, entrepreneurship was like turning an idea into a
plan and then presenting it to others. And in my view, market research
was merely collecting questionnaire data, and I completely failed to
realize that it was actually a crucial step for enterprises to
understand real users and test whether the direction was feasible.

Throughout the Aloe Vita project, I truly integrated theory with
practice. The several learning points that left the deepest impression
on me were Design Thinking, Lean Startup, Market Validation, and Team
Communication and Presentation.

At the beginning, we adopted the design thinking approach to re-examine
the product from the user's perspective. Previously, I was accustomed to
directly stating the conclusions in my analyses, but this time I learned
to "empathize" with the users and first understand why they need this
product before designing the solution. Through questionnaires and
interviews, we gradually gained an understanding of consumers'
impressions and demands for aloe beverage. I discovered that some people
are interested in "beauty benefits", while others are more concerned
about "health and naturalness". This made me realize that a successful
positioning must be based on real user feedback, rather than our own
assumptions.

When applying the mindset of lean startup, we also practiced the concept
of "rapid experimentation". Whenever the team had a new an idea like a
change in the packaging or a change in the brand story, we would discuss
first on how to confirm it with minimum cost and not just investing time
and resources blindly. These little experiments taught me that the
entrepreneurial rhythm is important indeed and not everything should
happen now, it should be changed gradually.

The numerous presentations in class also helped me improve my
communication and presentation skills. In the past, I made PPT without
thoughtfulness of the content. At this moment, I realize that the logic
and the manner of presentation are also crucial. The comment of the
teachers, as well as questions of my classmates, have provided me with
an additional confidence in the ability to share my views with others,
and have also taught me that all the members of the team have a
dissimilar communication style. The skill in organizing and listening is
the trick to successful collaboration.

Furthermore, listening to the founder of Aloe Vita share his insights on
the forum gave me a deeper understanding of the concept of "execution vs
idea". They said that ideas are never valuable; the key lies in who can
truly execute and constantly adjust the direction. At that moment, I
suddenly realized that entrepreneurship is not about telling a story,
but about turning the story into reality step by step.

Through this course, I have gained a new understanding of my future
career direction. Previously, I was more inclined towards creative jobs,
but now I am more interested in market research and brand strategies. I
believe that no matter what one does, the first step is to figure out
"whether the market accepts it", so learning to conduct research,
verification and analysis will be my most important ability in the
future.

Among all the courses, what I like the most is its practicality. Not
only do we study the theories, but we also conduct questionnaires,
interviews, and presentations ourselves, truly experiencing a
small-scale entrepreneurial process.

However, if possible, I hope the course can be improved in the following
three aspects:

First, arrange more face-to-face interactions with real entrepreneurs to
better understand the industry reality;

Second, teach us how to use research tools earlier, such as
questionnaire design and data analysis methods;

Third, I hope there will be a Pitch feedback session after the
presentation, allowing us to know where we can improve further.

This WIL experience taught me not only entrepreneurial knowledge, but
also a mindset of "from idea to action".

**Conclusion**

Looking back on the entire WIL course, I truly believe it was a very
special learning experience. Starting from the initial contact with the
Aloe Vita project, to conducting market research, conducting interviews,
giving presentations, and finally listening to the founder's sharing, I
gradually came to understand that entrepreneurship is not just an
"idea", but a series of specific actions and thoughts. The course
transformed me from someone who could only talk about theories into
someone who truly understands the market and knows how to validate
ideas.

I have learned how to apply the knowledge acquired in class to actual
projects, and also how to listen and cooperate within a team. This
experience has made me more certain that, whether starting a business or
entering the workplace in the future, the most important thing is to
understand the market, listen to users, and continuously improve.
Although the process is not easy, each step has given me more confidence
and made me clearer about the direction I want to take.

**Diary 1**

This week was the first class of the WIL program. The professor
introduced us to several different projects, including those related to
technological innovation, social enterprises, and consumer brands. At
first, I was a bit confused because each project seemed quite
interesting, but the directions were quite different.

Later, our group held a discussion.Everyone said they hoped to choose a
project that was closer to daily life and had market potential. As we
talked, we decided to select Aloe Vita - a carbonated beverage with aloe
vita as its main ingredient. We thought it combined "healthy diet" and
"beauty care", two themes that are currently particularly popular among
young people.

During the process of selecting the project, I was for the first time
fully aware of how many things need to be considered when undertaking a
startup project. It is not only how good is the idea but also how one
gets to determine the target market, consumers, and how he or she will
go about promoting it. The professor also cited in the classroom that a
good idea must have the ability of addressing real issues. This gave me
a reason to start thinking about whether the direction that we have
taken has enough demand in the market.

Furthermore, the group discussion also made me realize the importance of
cooperation. Everyone has his or her opinion, and it is namely this
variety that helps see issues through different prisms. Overall, this
week has provided me with a more intuitive perception of this course,
and I am also looking forward to emergence of collaborative work within
the team and future project development.

**Diary 2**

After deciding to do Aloe Vita, our group officially began preparing for
the first class presentation this week. The professor introduced several
analytical frameworks in class, such as market positioning, target
users, and channel strategies. We then started discussing based on these
directions.

At the beginning, there were a lot of different ideas among the group.
Being preoccupied with the health value, some believed that it should be
turned to the beauty and skincare, some of them offered to be “natural
and environmentally friendly”. We began a somewhat chaotic discussion
but later on we thought of applying the Design Thinking technique
discussed in the course, which begins with the lens of the consumers, to
determine initially what the consumers actually desire, and then
deliberate on how to position the same.

I was mainly responsible for collecting data and organizing ideas. It
was the task of the rest of the team members to design the PPT, market
data analysis, and locate case studies of rival brands. Following a
series of online deliberations, we identified the reasoning of the
presentation as three segments including market background, target users
and the positioning challenges. In developing the PPT, we also had to
make the order and content in the story repeatable to clarify the story.

This preparation experience has taught me a lot, especially how to
present an idea in a logical and persuasive manner. Although the process
was quite busy, the feeling of teamwork was great. Everyone complemented
each other, and the final presentation was much smoother than I had
expected.

**Diary 3**

This week, our team began to prepare for the market research of the Aloe
Vita project. To better understand the consumers, we decided to design
our own questionnaire. The goal was simple - to find out what people
think of this "aloe carbonated beverage" and whether they would actually
be willing to buy it.

At the beginning, our discussion was quite lively. Other individuals
believed that the taste and the packaging were more important whereas
others considered that health and cosmetic effects were more critical.
Afterwards under the design thinking approach that we had been taught in
the classroom, we began with “the real needs of the users” and slowly
established the problems. My primary roles included to arrange the ideas
of all members in well-logical, consistent questions, whereas the rest
of my team was to do the visual design and refinements of the options.

The questionnaire contains many practical questions, such as what types
of beverages people usually drink, what kind of packaging they prefer,
the acceptable price range, and whether they prioritize "health" or
"beauty". We also added several multiple-choice questions to see which
positioning consumers tend to prefer.

This process of conducting the questionnaire was quite interesting to
me, and it also made me realize for the first time the difficulties of
conducting market research. To actually ask useful questions, it's not
just about randomly listing a few options; rather, one needs to think
clearly about what they want to know. Through discussions, I also became
clearer about who our product might face as a potential market in the
future.

**Diary 4**

This week, our team continued to carry out the market research for the
Aloe Vita project. Last week, we collected a lot of questionnaire data
and held a meeting to summarize the results.We found that the points
that consumers were most concerned about were "health", "low sugar",
"natural", and some people were also quite interested in the concept of
"beauty drink" Based on these findings, we decided to design an
interview outline, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of people's
true opinions on the aloe beverage.

When discussing the interview content, we referred to the
semi-structured interview method mentioned in the class.We first
identified several topics: daily beverage habits, ways of discovering
new brands, impressions of aloe beverages, and understanding of the
concepts of "health" and "beauty". Finally, we also added some
open-ended questions, such as "If you could design an ideal aloe soda,
what flavor would you like it to have, what kind of packaging would you
prefer, and how much would you sell it for?" We hoped to hear more
genuine user ideas.

I was mainly responsible for organizing the questionnaire results into
interview questions and making the logic between the questions more
coherent. The team members contributed to the refining of language and
the language questions became more natural. In the process, I have
learned that user research is not all about asking questions as it is
also about aiding the respondents to speak the reasons behind the
question. With the way of how the interviews were being designed, we
started really knowing what the consumers thought in their own mind, and
this made me think that this project is slowly starting to seem like the
actual entrepreneurial process.

**Diary 5**

This week, our team participated in a startup forum event. Various teams
of people working on innovative projects were located at the event site,
one of which is the Aloe Vita project, which is under our research. It
was not the first time I saw an actual startup founder.To tell the truth
it was rather exciting.

The event began in the evening. The first was the free exchange session
during which we were allowed to discuss with various groups their
entrepreneurial experience. Others were involved in intelligent
agriculture, sustainable packaging and healthy food.Both of these
projects were extremely unique, and I had a self-impression that I have
entered into a “startup expo”, which expanded my horizons at once.

During the formal session, we also heard from the founder of Aloe Vita.
He had the original product idea, to establish a product, refreshing and
healthy, aloe bubble drink. She said that as they have gone through
product development and market test, they had numerous challenges,
including flavors, designs of packaging, and government limitations. But
still she was also determined to make the idea of natural health to be
the brand culture. At that, I had a more real-life perception of this
project and I better understood what we were talking about in our
course- "Entrepreneurship is not about ideas, but about execution."

This event gave me a lot of valuable insights.Not only did I witness the
enthusiasm of various entrepreneurs, but it also helped me clarify the
direction I want to focus on - how to turn an idea into a truly
implementable product.
