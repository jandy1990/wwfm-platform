# Overall WIL Experience

## Personal lessons

I’ve learned that I have improved my skills on delivering Project
Proposals, this was reflected on our feedback from the Course
Coordinator and Q Factorial CEO recognising that we covered applying
entrepreneurship frameworks such as Lean Startup to create our
methodology to approach every task that we need to deliver.

But I’ve discovered that I feel more comfortable working behind the
scenes rather than interacting with high amount of new people with
market research purposes, this was reflected on one of the most
difficult times for me that was reach drivers face-to-face and conduct
interviews because I felt high level of rejection, some of them avoid
interacting with me and refuse to share their contacts for a short
interview afterwards. To address that, I asked for support and examples
to my workmate and the CEO to learn how to increase my chances to get an
interview, both showing me how to have a proper initial conversation
with drivers to get their contact details and how to call them to have
an interview later respectivelly. Also, have resilience to recognize my
mistakes and change or improve my techniques based on feedback.

Furthermore, if I have the chance to start again, I would avoid being
control by my feelings, define specific techniques for social
interaction with drivers and improve my social skills beforehand. This
would helped me to obtain insights sooner and increase my chances to get
more data.

## Networks established

During this experience I expanded my network from different professional
backgrounds and perspectives. I met Q Factorial CEO Sharan Nambar who
has engineer background with experience leading product teams, also I
met my workmate Addison Emmert coming from Innovation and
Entrepreneurship major.

After that, to make market research, I interact with drivers from
different delivery companies such as Couriers Please, Australia Post and
DHL. For that, I visited their dispatch in the early morning to be on
their ecosystem and have a first connection, starting with a casual chat
about their job and then asking for their contact details to organise an
interview in the future, having a succeed of 10% of total of
interactions.

Furthermore, to increase my network I decided to try digital platforms
to find potential customers and new data. Because of that, I made a
connection with a Distribution and Operations Leader from Canada by
using LinkedIn. This was possible by using keywords about Route Planning
Software, finding his post looking for Routing Software recommendations
that optimize daily route planning, delivery efficiency and streamline
driver communication and tracking. Nowadays, he is using Circuit, but he
needs a stronger solver.

Lastly, through UQ Ventures Curiosity program, I connected with the
presenter who connected me with logistics workers from different
businesses such as coffee and stores providers. This experienced made me
learn that creating a networking chain can increase my chances to
connect with the market our startup is focusing on, following that
strategy I started asking every driver I interact to share me contact
details of their friends with the same field expanding my connections
and market insights significantly.

# New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills 

## The Past

Before this project, my previous knowledge was from taking a WIL Program
with the course Business Industry Consultancy Project last semester.
This gave me experience on doing market research and consultancy. I
consider my skill level was basic when I started the course because I
even though I knew what tasks I have to complete as a consultant, this
market it’s different from my previous experience and I needed to find
different ways to provide what the startup need.

## Key Learnings

I believe that the most important concepts I’ve learned during this WIL
experience are components of all three entrepreneurship theories
reviewed in this semester. Those were present on different stages and
made me develop and learn new skills.

First, according with Blank & Dorf (2020) the first of the 9 Deadly Sins
of the New Product Introduction Model of Lean Startup theory is making
assumptions that we know what customer want, this was reflected when we
assumed drivers want features focused on stop logging at the beginning,
but then we interviewed them and realised they prefer better arriving
and driving experience features. Because of that, I’ve learned that we
can’t assume what customers wants, we must interact with to identify
what is the reality. This is important because it’s essential to
determine if there is a market for your project and how big it is, with
that you can make decisions such as move forward or not and what are
going to be the next steps.

Furthermore, empathise stage on Design Thinking theory was one of the
main concepts I learned by interviewing several drivers face-to-face and
using Circuit intensively as an immersive experience. I used both ways
to understand drivers more because Liedtka & Ogilvie (2011) say that we
should study the context that users work on in which our project wants
to help. Apart from that, Wulandari et al. (2025) mention that this
principle it’s getting popular for App developing to ensure a
user-friendly experience, meaning that being on the shoes of the users
we want to satisfy it’s important.

Lastly, Effectuation’s lemonade principle was crucial for the getting
insights stage because we got surprised that most of the times drivers
don’t wat to have an interview after meeting them or share their
contacts. According with Sarasvathy (2022) we should address unpredicted
events as an opportunity to test ourselves on new situations. Based on
that, I reduce my number of questions focusing on the most valuable
insights we needed. This is relevant because improves my problem-solving
skills, increase my creativity to find solutions, and my resilience gets
better.

## The Future

In the next years, I will apply this key learning on my career to become
a better entrepreneur able to empathise and understand what customers
really want by avoiding making assumptions, solving a real problem
delivering a unique project without losing my drive to continue because
of contingency.

I believe that working with Q Factorial influence my thinking on keep
trying even I’m exposed to being rejected or feel shy and challenge
myself to find new techniques and overcome my fears. It’s very important
to don’t be afraid of rejection and keep trying consistently, my mindset
changed to be open to try, failing or not, and get surprised with the
results.

## Course Feedback

What I most value of this course is the immersive learning of running a
startup. I feel active learning it’s the most efficient way to learn for
me, and it’s satisfactory to feel I contributed to a project with high
potential. At the same time, getting advice in a positive work
environment makes this course unique because it’s more personalized
fixing what specific skills you need to improve and how.

My first suggestion for this course it’s increase the diversity of tasks
on each Start-Up, this can create a stronger alignment between startups
need with the students hard and soft skills, also those who are
interested on interact with the startup industry for the first time but
they have a different background, can contribute with the skills they
can offer in a better way.

Moreover, I consider that having a process tracker system and
established deadlines would be good for a better time management and
motivation resources. I feel that having an App that can give us a
constant overview of how we are progressing would motivate me to find
more effective ways of working and let everyone know how the project
it’s progressing in-real-time.

Finally, support giving better accessibility for market researcher for
highly niche customers would be amazing for those in my situation were
finding potential customers it’s the biggest challenge. This can be by
sharing techniques on how to find them and increase chances to get
insights, locations and times with high flow of people and access to
exclusive staff areas for businesses where customers gather and more.
With this, I would feel that my job it’s not impossible and that people
want to support me to become a better researcher.

# Diary Entries

## First Impression

On the startups presentations, Sharan Nambar showed Q Factorial that is
his project with high potential on optimize route planning by using
quantum computing. This presentation was impressive for me because
connected with my interest on technology and a personal story.
Therefore, I introduced myself to Sharan showing my interest on the
project and sharing what of my skills can match with Q Factorial.

With this, I’ve learned that startups are more willing to listen to
early-professionals and give opportunities on those they see potential,
desire to contribute and share their purpose. This is important to know
for those who doesn’t feel prepared enough to get their first
experience, remember that startups look for potential and upcoming
high-perform professionals it’s inspiring to prove myself and improve my
skills.

## Beginning

After that, I was confirmed on being part of Q Factorial with Addison
Emmert as a workmate. The next seminar we introduce each other looking
forward to work hard. But the first challenge appeared when we were
making our project proposal, we had some contributions problems both
feeling uncomfortable with each other. This was an effect of my lack of
communication with him and stress.

The output of this, is that I discovered that one of my weaknesses it’s
handling my emotions related with fatigue, making me take impulsive
decisions and don’t be professional. As a result, I understood how
important it’s to have a balance and rest well. Knowing myself it’s
important to ensure what’s better for me to give my best performance and
improve my emotional intelligence.

After that, Sharan asked us to use Circuit as an immersive way to get
insights, this connects with Design Thinking theory on emphasise with
customers. With that, I started making my first assumptions.

## Mid-Stage 

Then, it was time to make the first interactions with drivers. When I
started, I made a mistake on focusing on the wrong type of drivers (Uber
Eats and DoorDash), we needed those who have different routes daily and
25 stops per day or more. Knowing that, I asked for advice on ways to
connect with drivers to get the first insights.

After getting advice from Sharan, I tried to walk around several
shopping malls and talk with employees from different stores. Because of
that, I made a self-discovery that is I have social anxiety to interact
with older strangers on rush, I feel that I disturb them by seen their
expressions and lack of willingness to pay attention to me or answer my
questions, some of them said: “I don’t know”, “Sorry, I’m busy” and
more.

Everything was like that, until Sharan called a driver during a meeting
with us and organise a time with him to make an interview, that was
inspiring for us to continue working on connect with drivers. I was with
him on that interview, and the driver tell us where to find more drivers
and what time to go, with that information we made a new strategy.

## Refinement

My approach changed to go in-person to different locations where drivers
gather in the morning such as Couriers Please Brisbane, Aramex and DHL
in the airport. I consider this part of the WIL made me practice Lean
Startup and Effectuation theories. First, I assumed what drivers want
following my experience using Circuit and try to think like them but
then I realise that they prefer features other features by talking with
them. Also, most of drivers don’t want to move forward for an interview
and instead of stopping I overcome it reducing my number of questions to
get the most valuable insights possible under those conditions.

On the other hand, a big challenge was to increase the networking to
reach the desired number of interviews. To address that, I asked the
drivers if they can share me their workmates contact details and some of
them helped with that. Also, I tried to use social media platforms such
as LinkedIn, Discord and Reddit. Having freedom on being creative to
find solutions made me discover that I enjoy try new ways to complete my
tasks and it’s memorable for my future.

## WIL End

As a last step, we collected all the data and come with conclusions such
as what features to add and how to be competitive against Circuit and
other route planning software. For now, we will work on increasing the
number to get close to the objective as much as we can and make the MVP
for the first testing phase.

Even though we can’t reach the number of interviews needed, I feel
satisfied that I did my best reaching a niche market and unfavourable
conditions, learning that as an entrepreneur you need to be prepared for
rejection and trust strongly on the potential of your project to keep
moving forward. In the next years, I will work on apply all what I’ve
learn on this experience on my career and know myself more, all my
mistakes and challenges made me realise that knowing yourself and
resilience it’s important too to work smarter and with strategy, rather
than being perfect and don’t accept uncertainty.
