# Section 1: Overall WIL Experience

Personal lessons I learned from this WIL experience include an improved
understanding of the downward pressures placed on middle management
within GHD to turn over a profit. I knew this was a critical part of
their roles as Business Group Leaders, as they are the ones with whom
you discuss project financials. Still, I did not fully understand the
extent of pressure from regional management to ensure business group
profitability. Building on this, another key lesson I learned is the
importance of having a clear understanding of the task and its expected
results. This clarity is crucial in convincing managers to believe in
your teaching, ensuring they genuinely care and are willing to
incorporate your ideas. The WIL experience has been highly beneficial to
me, with key highlights including witnessing my work come to fruition in
a class-like environment where managers engage and apply the teachings
they have learnt. The difficult times, like managers not attending
because of prioritising other commitments (we were not able to make our
classes/meetings compulsory attendance, unfortunately) and managers not
caring/getting involved initially, have also been beneficial as they
have provided a great learning experience and an insight into what could
have been done differently next time.

In hindsight, I would have performed a more rigorous pre-framing
assessment to diagnose the depth of resistance among key leaders
earlier. While mitigation strategies were planned (securing a senior
sponsor), a deeper understanding of specific leader concerns (e.g., risk
perception vs. cost perception) could have refined the structure of the
two-day delivery workshop. We attempted to shorten the workshops, but
they still were not concise enough to sustain comprehensive engagement.

I had already formed strong connections with my classmates throughout
the degree, so I didn’t establish new networks during TIMS3311. Instead,
I focused on building important relationships within GHD's large
structure, particularly with its innovation team, and developed a
mentorship with senior staff member Chris Stevenson.

# Section 2: New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills

When I began this WIL engagement, I thought I had a good understanding
of innovation and entrepreneurship in practice. This knowledge stems
from connections who have created or operate their own businesses,
including my parents, and from accumulating knowledge over time, driven
by my personal passion for starting and operating a business. I gained
practical experience in innovation and entrepreneurship by helping my
mother manage a packaged nut vending machine business and other small
market stalls, continually seeking strategies to improve the
business and generate greater income flow. However, participating in
this program revealed that my skill level lacked the strategic knowledge
and academic understanding needed to drive innovation and
entrepreneurship from the ground up.

The most important learning was the synergistic application of
entrepreneurial methodologies to an organisational alignment problem, as
most of my career will most probably be in the larger corporate setting.
As the Primary framework, Design Thinking (specifically the How-Might-We
activity) was crucial for moving leaders past initial resistance. I
learned that the empathy stage applies internally as well. HMW allowed
us to gather data in the form of reframed opportunity statements,
forcing leaders to articulate a shared vision rather than just listing
roadblocks. I learned how to analyse this data by clustering themes,
showing where leaders agree and where gaps exist.

The application of Lean Startup's Build-Measure-Learn cycle via Problem
Interviews was vital for generating trustworthy evidence. I learned that
in a large, risk-averse company like GHD, executive confidence requires
concrete evidence. We used interviews to gather client quotes, recurring
pain points, and frequency counts, comparing leadership assumptions
against market reality. This approach helps mitigate the risk of
underinvestment caused by misalignment.

The Effectuation framework, particularly the Bird-in-Hand activity, was
the most impactful for fostering immediate action. I learned that in a
mature organisation, focusing on what GHD already has — who we are, what
we know, and whom we know — is the most effective way to secure
commitments. Concentrating on what is already at GHD's disposal directly
addresses hesitation by showing that action can be taken now, minimising
the perception of high upfront cost or risk. This application involved
linking available resources to the validated opportunities.

These concepts help in my current and future career roles by providing a
structured process to manage organisational change. I can now move
beyond performing services to actively shaping GHD's response to
shifting markets (sustainability and digital services) and intensifying
competition. These strategies would also benefit any potential future
startups I start.

The WIL experience influenced my career trajectory, increasing my desire
to pursue a managerial position in the future. I now aim to be a leader
who implements the "Leadership Innovation Alignment Pack" methodology to
create sustainable innovation. Suppose I were to provide leadership
within GHD. In that case, I hope to evolve the company from being a
reliable but traditional service provider to being recognised as
a forward-looking partner shaping the future. This experience has
prepared me to tackle issues related to governance, incentives, and
consistent leadership support necessary for innovation.

The best thing about this course is the collaboration between practical
learning on the job and theoretical understanding in the classroom. The
course provides the frameworks (e.g., Effectuation’s focus on affordable
loss) that allow one to structure a practical, phased solution for a
significant issue plaguing any size business, from startup to
multinational corporation. Some recommendations moving forward would be
for the course to consist of more practical learning, as that makes the
most sense for a penultimate course, trying to ensure its students are
best prepared for their careers in the workforce from the following
year. The rest of the degree provides more than enough time to cover the
required theoretical knowledge. Additionally, ensure that startup
students are working closely with them more frequently to facilitate the
strategy implementation process properly. Further, expanding the
curriculum content to include post-implementation enablers (such as
culture, governance, incentives, and measurement) would be beneficial
for ensuring long-term consistency and follow-through.

# Diary Entries

## Diary Entry 1: Facing Institutional Resistance (Early Stage)

I met with Chris Stevenson and finalised the scope: aligning GHD
leadership on innovation. I presented my initial findings about the
misalignment in the Brisbane Geotechnics team, noting that my leader
views innovation as a "nice to have". This perspective is frustrating
because GHD’s market demands (sustainability, digital services) require
agility. This feeling of institutional drag crystallised the scope. I
learned that misalignment is not passive; it actively causes employee
disengagement and underinvestment. The realisation that I needed to find
a strategic framework to overcome internal risk perceptions
(Objective 1) reframed the entire WIL task. It matters because success
hinges on turning hesitant attitudes into support for smaller projects.

## Diary Entry 2: Design Thinking in Action (Mid-Stage)

We ran the first facilitated session, using Design Thinking’s 'How Might
We' (HMW) activity. The initial prompts produced vague, defensive
statements. I intervened by re-explaining the need for
opportunity-focused reframing. Slowly, leaders began producing more
creative statements. The activity revealed, through the data
(opportunity statements), that leaders fundamentally disagreed on what a
strategic opportunity even looked like (cost- or opportunity-minded?). I
learned that Design Thinking’s core function here was not solution
generation, but creating internal empathy and a shared
vision. This matters because HMW provided the data needed to move past
assumptions and create a prioritised set of focus areas for validation.

## Diary Entry 3: Validating Assumptions (Mid-Stage)

I spent a day synthesising the data from Lean Startup’s 'Problem
Interviews'. We interviewed eight clients and stakeholders. The data
(client quotes and pain point frequency counts) showed that some of the
opportunities identified by the leaders in HMW were actually
low-priority problems for the market. What happened was a stark contrast
between internal managerial assumptions and external market reality. I
learned the power of the Lean Startup 'validate' principle—using
evidence from clients to build executive confidence. This matters
immensely because in a large organisation, credibility is everything;
providing a validated problem set backed by evidence prevents leaders
from dismissing the proposed innovation direction.

## Diary Entry 4: Securing Commitment via Effectuation (Late-Stage)

The main delivery workshop concluded with
the Effectuation 'Bird-in-Hand' activity. Instead of asking for new
budgets, we focused on mapping GHD’s existing resources—who we are, what
we know, and whom we know. What happened was immediate positive
engagement, as the exercise minimised perceived risk (affordable loss).
Leaders specifically linked available resources (e.g., expertise in the
digital collaboration platform, Teams) to the validated opportunities. I
learned that Effectuation is the crucial 'supporting framework' for
implementation in mature, risk-averse settings. Effectuation matters
because the outcome of this activity was concrete leadership
commitments, which form the action component of the Alignment Pack and
prevent the risk of outputs not translating into action.

## Diary Entry 5: The Need for Follow-Through (Post-Workshop)

The final phase of the WIL involved a follow-up two weeks after the
workshop. We circulated the consolidated outputs (the Alignment Pack)
and asked leaders to confirm their commitments. What happened was that
despite the strong initial engagement, some middle managers immediately
deprioritised follow-up, demonstrating the risk of leadership
disengagement. I realised the process of alignment requires more than
just a workshop; it needs continuous visibility and accountability. I
learned that establishing the enablers (governance and culture) is
essential for maintaining momentum. This matters because securing a
change in attitude and obtaining support for minor projects relies
entirely on swift, practical follow-through.
