                             1
When I first started working on OTO, I didn’t imagine how much it would change me. What began
as a small idea to fix frustrations in my own piano and guitar lessons evolved into something that
pushed me to learn, experiment, and grow. Through my WIL in TIMS3311, I’ve applied three
main theories Effectuation, Lean Startup, and Design Thinking not only in class but in real
decision-making. This experience wasn’t just about building an app; it was about learning how to
build myself as an entrepreneur.

1. The Overall WIL Experience

My WIL journey was messy, challenging, and full of surprises. From day one, I was forced to rely
on myself. I had no formal coding background but decided to build the first version of OTO using
Replit and AI support. I kept hitting walls especially when setting up WebRTC for real-time
lessons and some days felt like I was going backwards. But even those frustrating moments taught
me more than any smooth success ever could.

One of the hardest parts was staying within budget. To keep OTO lean, I committed to only
spending about AUD $150 so far. That decision came from the idea of affordable loss, a key
principle of Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001). Instead of betting everything on a perfect app, I risked
only what I could afford to lose. That mindset allowed me to experiment freely without feeling
paralysed by fear.

Yet the highlight came when I began testing with real users. In interviews with Pejman
(piano/harmony teacher) and Andre (guitar teacher), I found that my assumption that call quality
was the main issue was only partly true. They cared more about teaching tools: fretboard overlays,
notation sharing, and split screens. That pivot in insight reflects both Design Thinking (which
pushes you to empathise and redefine the problem) and Lean Startup (which demands you test
assumptions and pivot quickly).

Looking back, I wish I had started interviews even earlier, before trying to perfect the tech. But
that’s the reality of entrepreneurship progress isn’t linear. Through this process, I learned patience,
resilience, and how iteration leads to better outcomes.




                                                                                                     2
2. Networks and Ecosystem

During the OTO project, I realised that the most valuable part of this course wasn’t just learning
frameworks it was the people I connected with. My WIL experience helped me build new networks
both inside and outside the classroom. Talking with other student founders helped me think
differently. For example, one of them suggested that I should also interview parents of students,
not just teachers. That small idea opened a new perspective: OTO could include features like
progress tracking and reports for parents, making the platform more useful for both sides.

In the broader startup ecosystem, my network grew a lot through the 20 teacher interviews I ran
including music instructors from Iran and Australia across instruments like guitar, piano, vocals,
and violin. These conversations gave me a clearer picture of how teachers actually run their online
lessons. I found out that many are moving away from institutions because they prefer the
independence of managing their own schedules and payments. This means the demand for digital
tools that support self-employed teachers is growing fast.

Each interview revealed something new: teachers talked about the costs of internet and software
subscriptions, and the frustration of switching between multiple apps for calls, notes, and resources.
I also realised there’s a global pattern in markets like Iran, teachers rely heavily on Telegram or
WhatsApp for lessons, which aren’t designed for education. That confirmed that OTO could fill a
real gap. In short, my network helped me validate OTO’s purpose and improve it. These
relationships weren’t just connections they became the foundation for how I shaped the next steps
of the project.




                                                                                                    3
3. New Knowledge, Insights, and Practical Skills

When I started this course, I already knew the basic theories like Effectuation and Lean Startup
from previous entrepreneurship units, but I had never seen them play out in real life. Working on
OTO changed that. It turned theories from just concepts into something I could apply and see
results from.

The Past.

Before OTO, my understanding of entrepreneurship was mainly surface-level. I could define an
MVP or value proposition, but I had never built one myself or validated it with users. I also didn’t
have any technical background I’d never coded before so the idea of building something functional
seemed impossible.

Key Learnings and Skills.

The biggest growth came from seeing how the three frameworks connected.

   •   Effectuation taught me to start with what I have my skills in music, my experience with
       online lessons, and my connections with teachers. That’s how I managed to get my first
       pilot testers and start small without overplanning.
   •   Lean Startup helped me focus on quick experiments instead of perfection. I built the MVP
       on Replit to keep costs low and test whether smoother online lessons with integrated tools
       worked (Ries, 2011).
   •   Design Thinking made me focus on empathy and usability. The interviews with 20
       teachers and students showed me that the real value was in tools that made lessons easier
       and more interactive, not just better video calls (Brown, 2008).

Learning to code on Replit was another major skill. It pushed me to understand how WebRTC
enables real-time connections and how backend and frontend systems communicate. I also became
more analytical after getting feedback from my lecturer, I went back and analysed over 15
competitors, understanding their features, pricing, and market positions.




                                                                                                  4
The Future.

Out of all the theories, Effectuation had the most personal impact. It showed me that I don’t need
to wait for the “perfect time” or external funding to start I can build from what I already have. That
mindset now shapes how I think about every project I’ll do in the future.

4. The Future and Course Reflection

This WIL experience has completely changed how I see entrepreneurship and my career. Before,
I thought entrepreneurship was about building something huge or chasing funding. Now, I
understand it’s about solving real problems and creating something meaningful, even if it starts
small.

OTO made me realise why I chose this major: I enjoy building, experimenting, and taking control
of creative ideas. I’ve learned that I thrive in environments where I can innovate and take
responsibility. I no longer see myself fitting into a traditional corporate path I want to keep building
ventures that merge creativity and technology.

Even though OTO is still early, it has already shaped how I think long term. My next step is to
finalise the foundation of the app before adding the requested teaching tools. Once the base is
stable, I plan to expand testing to domestic teachers in Australia and eventually release the first
public version. Whether OTO becomes a large platform or remains niche, it’s already shown me
how to turn an idea into action.

The project taught me that opportunities don’t appear you create them. The first step is always the
hardest, but once you start, things begin to align. I’ve learned to manage risk, adapt quickly, and
stay consistent even when results aren’t immediate.




                                                                                                      5
Course Feedback

What I valued most about this course was how practical it was every concept connected directly
to my venture. The mix of theory and action made the lessons more meaningful. If I could suggest
improvements, I’d recommend:

   1. More technical support sessions for students building MVPs with no coding background.
   2. Networking opportunities with startup founders or alumni from previous WIL cohorts.
   3. Workshops focused on interviewing and validation techniques since user insights shape
       everything.

Conclusion

The OTO project became more than a university task; it became a reflection of who I am and who
I want to become. It challenged me to think, adapt, and act like a real entrepreneur. I’ve learned
that building something meaningful takes time, but it starts with courage and clarity. This WIL
experience didn’t just teach me how to innovate it taught me how to believe in my ability to create
change.

Diary Entry 1 Why OTO and How It Started

Date: 7th September 2025

Stage: Early Concept MVP Foundation

Today I’ve been thinking about how OTO actually started. It goes back to when Skype shut
down and everything moved to Teams. Around that time, I was doing my piano and guitar
lessons online, and honestly, the whole process just didn’t feel right. The sound would lag, the
quality was off, and I had to use multiple apps just to get through one lesson. That’s when it hit
me why hasn’t anyone built a proper platform for music teachers and students that actually
works?

I was already using Replit for another project, so I thought I’d give it a go myself. I started with a
small MVP idea that could handle calls, scheduling, and messaging all in one place. I didn’t have
much coding experience, so learning WebRTC for the video and audio calls was a grind, but
seeing it start to work was motivating. It reminded me that even without a team or big funding,
you can still make something real if you stay consistent.

This made me realise how much I was already applying Effectuation’s Bird-in-Hand principle
without even knowing it using what I had, what I knew, and who I knew. My background in
music gave me a clear sense of what was missing, and that became my starting point. That’s
where OTO really began from a simple frustration turned into something I wanted to fix myself.




                                                                                                     7
Diary Entry 2 Building and Testing the MVP

Date: 14th September 2025

Stage: MVP Development and Early Validation

This week I’ve been focusing on improving OTO’s first version and testing how teachers might
actually use it. I had two key interviews one with my piano teacher, Pejman Ghezelbash, who
also runs his own music institute, and another with my guitar instructor, Andre Khajekian. Both
of them gave me insights that completely changed how I looked at the app.

Initially, I thought the main selling point for OTO was the lossless quality and low-latency video
calls. But through these interviews, I realised teachers wanted much more than just better call
quality. They wanted teaching tools things that actually make lessons smoother. Pejman told me
he needed a split-screen for piano and a feature for teaching harmony that works like MuseScore
but in real time. Andre wanted an AI fretboard reader that could recognise his playing without
needing to plug in a MIDI cable. That feedback hit me it wasn’t just about calls, it was about
building a full experience around teaching.

From a learning point of view, this really connected with Design Thinking, especially the
Empathy and Define stages. Listening to them helped me see that my assumptions were wrong
and that users define the real direction of the product. It also taught me that real innovation
comes from asking better questions, not just coding new features.

I’ve also realised that being solo on this project means learning how to wear every that
developer, designer, and founder but that’s exactly what’s making me grow. Every step, even the
confusing ones, is teaching me something about how to turn ideas into something people actually
want.

Diary Entry 3 Competitor Research and Market Insights

Date: 21st September 2025

Stage: Validation and Market Understanding

After the first two interviews, I decided to reach out to more teachers from Pejman’s institute and
Andre’s network to get a clearer picture of what’s really happening in the industry. I ended up
talking to around ten teachers in total including vocal, violin, and classical guitar instructors.
What stood out the most was how differently everyone runs their online classes, yet all of them
share the same frustrations: poor sound quality, switching between too many apps, and unreliable
scheduling tools.

Many of them currently use Zoom for lessons, Google Drive for resources, and WhatsApp for
communication a messy setup that costs time and energy. They also mentioned the hidden costs
of running lessons online: fast internet plans, microphones, and even paying separate fees to
music institutions for hosting or listing their services. But what surprised me was how many are
slowly moving away from those institutions altogether. They prefer teaching independently
because it gives them freedom no middlemen, no fees, just direct lessons with students. That’s
when it clicked for me: OTO could be the platform that supports independent teachers, not
replaces institutions.

This deeper look at the ecosystem made me realise that OTO’s real value isn’t just better
technology it’s giving teachers the freedom to build their own online teaching business. I also
noticed that this aligns perfectly with Effectuation’s “crazy quilt” principle, where you form
partnerships with people who share your goals. Each conversation opened up a new idea or
perspective that reshaped how I saw OTO and its potential place in the market.

Diary Entry 4 Technical Challenges and Learning Through
AI Development

Date: 28th September 2025

Stage: Product Development and Experimentation

This week has been all about trying to actually bring OTO to life. After the interviews and
validation, I decided to start developing the WebRTC (real-time video call) technology for the
app using Replit. The goal right now is to build a solid foundation first a smooth, lossless call
experience and then later start adding the specific teaching tools that the teachers said they
wanted, like the AI fretboard reader and piano split-screen feature.

It’s been a tough learning curve. I don’t have a coding background, so I’ve been relying
completely on AI agents to help me build and debug everything from the backend logic to the
signaling system for peer-to-peer calls. Some days it feels like I make progress, and other days
it’s just endless trial and error. Getting WebRTC to actually work smoothly has been frustrating,
especially without a tech background, but at the same time, I’ve learned a lot about patience and
problem-solving.

The costs are slowly adding up too I’ve already spent around $150 on hosting, Replit
subscriptions, and testing features. Still, I’m looking at it through the Lean Startup principle of
“affordable loss.” I’m not trying to make something perfect I just want to get something
working, learn from it, and then improve it step by step.

Even though it’s been stressful, I can see how every mistake helps me understand the process
better. What used to feel impossible now feels like something I can eventually master. This
whole stage really showed me that entrepreneurship isn’t about having all the answers it’s about
figuring things out as you go and trusting that consistent effort pays off.




                                                                                                      10
Diary Entry 5 Reflection, Limitations and Future Steps

Date: 5 October 2025

Stage: Reflection and Future Planning

As this phase of the WIL wraps up, I’ve realised how much clarity I’ve gained about where OTO
needs to go next. Up to this point, I’ve conducted around 20 interviews with music teachers from
different backgrounds piano, guitar, vocals, violin, and harmony to understand what they really
need from an online platform. Even though I spoke to a mix of local and international teachers,
most of the strong feedback and long-term interest came from the overseas side, especially from
Pejman Ghezelbash and Andre Khajekian, who are both active in the international teaching
scene.

Because of that, I’ve decided to narrow my focus to overseas markets first. The reality is, it’s
been tough finding teachers in Australia who are open to trying something new most already
have their systems set up with Zoom and payment tools. So, for now, I’m keeping my focus on
where the opportunity is clearer. The idea is to finalise the foundational version of OTO (the
WebRTC-based calling system) and make sure it works smoothly before adding the tools the
teachers requested, like the AI fretboard reader and the piano split-screen. Once that’s solid, I’ll
start reaching out again in Australia with something concrete to show a product that actually
works.

This stage helped me understand that entrepreneurship is about pacing yourself. I can’t chase
everything at once, so focusing on one market at a time feels like the right step. It’s also taught
me that every setback, from technical bugs to people saying “no,” is part of the process. I’m still
motivated to push forward I know once I have a working version in hand, I’ll be able to do more
interviews, door-knocking, and demonstrations to build the next wave of users and partners.




                                                                                                      11
Looking back, I’m proud of how far OTO has come from just being an idea to something real
that people are actually testing. The next chapter will be about scaling slowly, learning from real
users, and shaping OTO into a platform that truly bridges musicians and technology.




                                                                                                 12
