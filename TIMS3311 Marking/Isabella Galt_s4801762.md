# Critical Reflection 

## 1. Overall WIL Experience 

### Personal lessons 

My WIL experience with Eclipse, a biotechnology start-up developing
lactoferrin for cosmetic applications has been a deeply practical and
personal journey. Working across weekly meetings with Siobhan, class
collaboration sessions, and individual research time, I’ve come to
understand that innovation rarely follows a fixed path. Instead, it
demands adaptability, curiosity, and reflection.

 

One of the most significant insights I learned about myself was that I
perform best when working in conditions of uncertainty. Initially, I
found the project’s open-ended structure challenging there were no
predefined steps, clear guidelines, or obvious solutions but I soon
realised that uncertainty pushes me to think creatively and take
initiative. However, over time, I grew more comfortable operating within
uncertainty. The persistant nature of our work, from initial store
observations, interview questions, surveys to empathy mapping, taught me
to trust the process and lean on frameworks such as Effectuation, which
emphasises acting with the means available and co-creating outcomes
through experimentation *(Sarasvathy, 2001).*

 

A major highlight was seeing our research evolve through each stage.
During empathy mapping, I realised how rewarding it was to turn
fragmented insights from interviews and surveys into clear behavioural
patterns. It showed me how integral empathy and synthesis are to
innovation. On the other hand, time management and aligning team
schedules were difficult. Coordinating tasks between weekly meetings,
lectures, and independent work often created tension. I learned to
navigate these moments by setting smaller, achievable milestones and
applying Design Thinking’s iterative “empathise-define-test” process
*(Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011)* to prioritise progress over perfection.

 

Another challenge was refining communication, translating large amounts
of data into concise visuals and presentations. I learned that
simplicity and clarity often carry more impact than complexity. In
hindsight, if I could redo the WIL to the very start, I would focus more
on measurable validation criteria early on. This would have given our
team stronger quantitative evidence to complement the qualitative
insights we gathered from interviews and MVP testing. Ultimately, this
experience has built my confidence in navigating uncertainty,
collaborating under pressure, and approaching entrepreneurship as a
learning process grounded in reflection and adaptability.

### Networks established 

Throughout the placement, I developed valuable professional and
interpersonal networks that extended well beyond my immediate team.
Within our Eclipse group, collaboration became a genuine strength, we
learned to draw on each other’s capabilities, whether it was data
interpretation, creative design, or interview facilitation. These
relationships built trust and accountability, mirroring the Effectuation
principle of the “crazy quilt,” where partnerships form the foundation
for co-creating new ventures *(Sarasvathy, 2001).*

Externally, our weekly discussions with Siobhan provided direct insight
into the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Her experience as a founder exposed
me to the realities of managing uncertainty, investor relationships, and
product-market alignment. Interactions with store staff, beauty
professionals, and potential customers during our validation stages also
broadened my understanding of stakeholder engagement. These connections
were not just transactional, they offered perspective, mentorship, and
professional confidence that I will carry forward into future innovation
and leadership contexts.

## 2. New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills

### Key learnings

Before beginning my WIL placement with Eclipse, I had a theoretical
understanding of innovation from previous coursework but limited
experience applying entrepreneurial methodologies in a real start-up.
Over the course of the placement, I developed a grounded understanding
of three frameworks that now shape how I approach creative
problem-solving: Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Effectuation. Each
moved from abstract theory to a practical tool for navigating
uncertainty, enabling me to test, learn, and iterate with purpose.

The Design Thinking framework *(Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011)* reshaped how I
understand empathy - not as a soft skill but as a structured method for
uncovering consumer insight. Liedtka and Ogilvie describe empathy as
“seeing the world through your customer’s eyes,” allowing innovators to
detect unmet needs that may not be directly expressed. This approach
became central to me and my groups early work at Eclipse. Using empathy
mapping, our team analysed what participants said, did, thought, and
felt across three segments of female consumers, male consumers, and
beauty professionals to reveal the emotional and practical factors
driving skincare decisions.

Conducting store observations at Mecca, Sephora, and Chemist Warehouse
before writing interview questions embodied the empathise and define
stages of Design Thinking. Observing shoppers linger over “gentle” or
“science-backed” products revealed that consumer trust and brand
familiarity mattered as much as function. As *(Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011)*
notes, design thinkers focus on “observing behaviour and context, not
just words.” This insight reframed our problem from “What can
lactoferrin do?” to “How can we build trust in a new skincare
ingredient?” anchoring our research in emotional understanding rather
than technical performance.

The Lean Startup methodology *(Ries, 2011)* then introduced a
disciplined way to validate what we observed. Ries defines
entrepreneurship as “a process of learning what customers really want,”
achieved through small, rapid experiments. Applying his
build-measure-learn cycle, we built basic yet effective MVPs survey
visuals testing consumer preference for serums, moisturisers, or
sunscreen to be able to test which product would be most successful
infused with lactoferrin; then measured responses through ranked-choice
questions and open-ended feedback. We learned that “science-backed” and
“natural” were the most resonant propositions, guiding our next MVP
iteration.

Each experiment reinforced that progress depends not on execution speed
but on learning efficiency. When some respondents were unfamiliar with
the term lactoferrin, we simplified our language and re-tested using
“fermented protein complex.” Ries’s (2011) principle that MVPs “maximise
learning per unit of time” became our benchmark. This iterative approach
taught me to prioritise testing assumptions over perfecting concepts, a
shift from planning to active discovery that changed how I now interpret
data and consumer behaviour.

The Effectuation framework *(Sarasvathy, 2001)* and *(Sarasvathy, 2022)*
completed this learning by reframing how I think about uncertainty.
Sarasvathy argues that entrepreneurs “control what they can rather than
predict what they cannot” *(Sarasvathy, 2001),* working with available
means of who they are, what they know, and whom they know. This mindset
perfectly captured our situation with Eclipse, where resources were
limited, outcomes kept shifting, and the path forward uncertain. We
applied the affordable loss principle by investing only the time and
effort necessary to gain useful insights from MVP tests, ensuring that
failure remained a source of learning, not risk.

The crazy quilt principle of forming partnerships with committed
collaborators was evident in our teamwork and engagement with Siobhan,
Eclipse’s founder, and industry professionals. Their input shaped how we
positioned lactoferrin in the skincare market. As *(Sarasvathy, 2022)*
observes, “entrepreneurship is a process of co-creation,” and our
collaboration reflected this shared agency. Equally, the lemonade
principle, of turning surprises into opportunities proved
transformative. When interviews and surveys revealed limited male
engagement with skincare, we reframed it as strategic insight, focusing
instead on female consumers and professionals as the key consumer entry
markets which then formed our decisions of finding suitable brands that
will be suitable for this market. This flexibility embodied Effectual
logic by adapting to change rather than resisting it.

Together, these frameworks created a layered methodology for innovation.
Design Thinking grounded me and the group in empathy and user
observation; Lean Startup provided structure for iterative testing; and
Effectuation fostered adaptability when outcomes were unpredictable.
Their intersection was clearest during MVP testing: we empathised to
select compelling imagery (Design Thinking), tested and refined
propositions through real-time feedback (Lean Startup), and adjusted
scope based on feasible resources (Effectuation).

 

### The Future 

This WIL experience has had a significant impact on how I see my career
in marketing. Before working with Eclipse, I viewed marketing primarily
through the lens of communication and branding. Now, I understand it as
a dynamic process of experimentation, empathy, and value creation
concepts deeply rooted in entrepreneurship. The Lean Startup cycle of
build-measure-learn *(Ries, 2011)* has reshaped how I approach campaign
design. Rather than aiming for the perfect strategy from the start, I
now focus on testing ideas rapidly, analysing feedback, and pivoting
when needed.

 

The Design Thinking process *(Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011)* has also
influenced how I approach consumer insight. In future marketing roles,
I’ll use empathy mapping to uncover deeper motivations behind consumer
choices and design creative strategies that respond to those needs.
Meanwhile, Effectuation *(Sarasvathy, 2001)* has taught me to think
resourcefully, leveraging available networks and opportunities to
co-create with stakeholders rather than waiting for ideal conditions.

 

More broadly, I now see entrepreneurship not only as creating ventures
but as a transferable approach to leadership, one that values feedback,
reflection, and co-creation. This WIL experience has strengthened my
interest in roles that bridge innovation and education, where human
centred design and agile experimentation can drive lasting impact.

 

### Course feedback

What I valued most in this WIL program was its authenticity and
independence. Working directly with a real start up like Eclipse
required applying entrepreneurial frameworks: Design Thinking, Lean
Startup, and Effectuation, in a practical and often unpredictable
context. The combination of guided structure and self-direction mirrored
the reality of innovation work, teaching me how to manage uncertainty
and adapt through experimentation.

 

For improvement, my first suggestion would be to include earlier MVP
guidance, providing clearer examples or templates for hypothesis testing
and validation. Second, I believe weekly online check-ins should be made
mandatory rather than optional. The opportunity to join live sessions
and receive immediate feedback was valuable for maintaining momentum and
refining direction. Lastly, I recommend strengthening post WIL
integration, linking final project outcomes to employability resources
or digital portfolios to help students better translate their learning
into professional growth.

# Reflective Diary Entries 

### Diary Entry 1

**Topic:** Beginning our external validation through market observation

 

After presenting our initial pitch for Eclipse, we’ve now started our
external validation phase to better understand the skincare market for
lactoferrin. As a team, we’ve agreed that the best place to start is
with real-world observation to see who’s buying skincare, what they’re
choosing, and why. Our goal right now is to gain genuine, firsthand
insight into consumer behaviour before moving into interviews.

 

We’ve spent this week visiting Mecca, Sephora, and Chemist Warehouse to
observe shoppers, product displays, and brand engagement. It’s been
fascinating to watch how people interact with different shelves and
price points. Moisturisers and cleansers clearly dominate. In Chemist
Warehouse, Cetaphil, CeraVe, and La Roche-Posay are everywhere -
affordable, dermatologist-backed brands that people seem to trust. In
Mecca, Dermalogica and Drunk Elephant draw the most attention, while
Sephora shoppers seem especially drawn to The Ordinary and Tatcha, the
Korean-inspired skincare brand. I’ve noticed that younger customers lean
toward influencer driven, trendy brands, while older shoppers gravitate
to science-backed and premium products. Interestingly, there are far
more male shoppers in Chemist Warehouse than in the higher-end stores.

 

Seeing this firsthand really brings Lean Startup’s validated learning
principle to life, testing assumptions through observation rather than
theory. It also feels like Design Thinking’s Empathise stage in action.
I’m starting to see how important it is to understand who we’re
designing for before defining what to create.

 

These early insights are already shaping our direction. They’re showing
me that lactoferrin’s success won’t just depend on its science, it’ll
depend on consumer trust, positioning, and how seamlessly it fits into
existing routines. Right now, observation feels like the most powerful
learning tool we have.

###  Diary Entry 2

**Topic:** Designing and refining our interview process

 

After completing our store observations, our next step in the external
validation phase was to design interviews to test our early insights
about the skincare market for Eclipse’s lactoferrin. Our team decided to
interview a broad mix of females, males, and beauty retail professionals
to ensure a range of perspectives across demographics and purchasing
behaviours. We also aimed for diversity in age, recognising that
attitudes toward skincare and willingness to pay often shift with life
stage and income.

While writing our first set of questions, I noticed that we were getting
too specific too quickly. We kept circling back to what we thought was
interesting about lactoferrin instead of leaving room for the customer
to guide us. We’ve since shifted direction and broadened our questions
to focus on past behaviour - asking things like when participants last
tried a new skincare ingredient, what made them trust it, how they
researched it, and what convinced them to buy. Focusing on real
experiences rather than hypotheticals feels much more valuable, because
past behaviour usually predicts future choices.

 

This process really reminds me of the Lean Startup cycle: build,
measure, learn and the Design Thinking stages of Empathise and Define.
It’s helping me see that we’re not here to prove our ideas right but to
listen, observe, and adapt.

 

Right now, I’m realising that effective validation comes from curiosity,
not confirmation. These open, behaviour-based questions are already
giving us richer insights into trust, buying triggers, and ingredient
perceptions, all the things that will eventually help Eclipse build a
product people genuinely want.

 

### Diary Entry 3

**Topic:** Conducting interviews and uncovering consumer patterns

 

We’re now deep in the external validation phase, and today we’ve started
running our customer interviews to test our early assumptions and guide
Eclipse’s potential minimum viable product (MVP). Our team has organised
interviews with a mix of female and male participants from different age
groups, along with one beauty-retail professional, so we can capture a
broad range of skincare routines, spending habits, and ingredient
awareness.

 

One of our key questions is, “When it comes to skincare, what products
do you prefer and why?” This is helping us see where lactoferrin could
realistically fit into daily routines. So far, almost every participant
has mentioned moisturisers, cleansers, serums, and sunscreens as their
most essential products. It’s interesting that, regardless of age, those
three keep repeating - they feel like clear MVP categories worth testing
first.

 

As we move through the interviews, I’m noticing a pattern. Female
participants give longer, more detailed answers - talking about
ingredient science, texture, and brand trust - while male participants
keep things brief, focusing on convenience or just using whatever’s
available. It’s making us question whether a unisex approach would truly
work for a first launch.

 

Running these interviews feels like putting Lean Startup’s
validated-learning loop into action: gathering evidence, adjusting
direction, and refining hypotheses. It also mirrors Design Thinking’s
Define stage, where real user feedback sharpens understanding.
Personally, I’m learning to hold back my own assumptions and let
patterns speak for themselves.

 

Right now, it feels like a breakthrough - we’re finally seeing what real
consumers value. Understanding these differences is giving us the
clarity we need to define who Eclipse should focus on first and what
product type makes the strongest starting point.

 

###  Diary Entry 4 

**Topic:** Developing and distributing MVP surveys

We’ve just finished our interviews, and now we’re designing Eclipse’s
first MVP surveys to test our early product ideas for lactoferrin in
cosmetics. Our focus right now is to figure out which skincare format
moisturiser, serum, cleanser or sunscreen has the most potential and
what kind of messaging connects best with people: science-backed
efficacy, natural purity, or luxury lifestyle. Using Lean Startup
thinking, we want to validate these ideas quickly and affordably through
SurveyMonkey, simple landing-page mock-ups, and QR code flyers.

 

At first, our questions were far too detailed more like a full market
research study than an MVP test. We realised we needed something visual,
concise, and easy to respond to. Now we’re building surveys with
20–30-word product descriptions paired with product mock-ups, asking
people to rank their preferences and tell us why. This “show-don’t-tell”
approach feels much more realistic, it’s like stepping into Design
Thinking’s Prototype stage, turning ideas into something people can
react to instead of imagining.

 

To reach real consumers, we’re sharing the survey across Facebook
skincare communities, beauty group chats, and flyers in Mecca, Sephora,
and Chemist Warehouse, bus stops with QR codes that link straight to our
form (Figure 4 below). We’re already noticing how much more engaged
people are when they can see something instead of just reading about it.

 

Right now, I’m learning how powerful effectual thinking can be using
what we have and improving as we go. People respond best to visuals,
simplicity, and clear choices. These surveys are helping us move from
abstract ideas to tangible validation, testing not just what consumers
say, but how they react. It feels like a real turning point in shaping
Eclipse’s first viable product direction.

### Diary Entry 5 

**Topic:** Empathy mapping and analysing user insights

We’re now at the stage of pulling everything together. With all our
interview and MVP survey data in front of us, our team is working
through the empathy mapping process to turn raw feedback into meaningful
insights for Eclipse’s final Business Model Canvas (BMC). We’ve decided
to create two separate empathy maps, one based on our interview findings
and another on the survey results, so we can see whether people’s stated
attitudes match their actual choices when responding to visuals and
product mock-ups.

 

To make sense of the data, we’re grouping participants into female
consumers, male consumers, and beauty professionals. For each, we’re
mapping what they say, do, think, and feel about skincare and new
ingredients like lactoferrin. The female group consistently mentions
“trust,” “gentleness,” and “visible results,” showing how much they
value credible science and reassurance. The male group focuses on
practicality and convenience, seeing skincare as something that should
“just work.” The beauty professionals provide a more technical view
talking about ingredient credibility, irritation risk, and growing
interest in “clean science.”

 

It’s been challenging but rewarding. Some insights align neatly, while
others contradict each other, forcing us to dig deeper as a team. I can
see how much sharper our thinking has become through these discussions.

 

Right now, this feels like Design Thinking’s Synthesis phase in action,
organising scattered observations into something clear and usable.
Creating these two empathy maps is giving us structure and direction,
helping us define customer segments and value propositions that will
guide Eclipse’s BMC and next stage of market validation.
