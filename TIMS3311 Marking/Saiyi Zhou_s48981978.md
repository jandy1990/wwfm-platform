**Introduction**

When I started the WIL entrepreneurship program, I thought it would
teach me how to “do” startups like pitch decks, market validation, maybe
a bit of design thinking. Instead, it taught me how to “feel” startups —
the uncertainty, the frustration, and the quiet moments of sudden
clarity after weeks of confusion. I joined because I wanted to
understand innovation and entrepreneurship. What I didn’t expect was
that I’d end up understanding myself much better along the way.

Our team’s project revolved around loneliness, this is a topic that
sounds simple until you try to solve it. Working on a problem that is
emotional rather than technical forced me to confront how limited
business frameworks can be when human emotions are involved. This
reflection looks back at how the WIL experience reshaped my ideas about
leadership, teamwork, and learning, and how it continues to influence
the kind of entrepreneur I want to become.

**I. The Overall WIL Experience**

**Personal Lessons**

To summarize what I gained from this experience: I learned how to act
swiftly while maintaining focus. However, as the project progressed, I
realized that rapid advancement is only effective when the team shares a
common goal.

Certain moments are electrifying: witnessing our ideas come to life,
hearing laughter during team meetings, realizing we're building
something tangible. But more often, it's long stretches of frustration,
slow progress, and occasional conflicts. I've learned to stop viewing
these as “setbacks” and instead see them as signals of growth. Every
disagreement or failed experiment reveals crucial truths: about our
assumptions, our users, or ourselves.

The biggest shift happened internally. I began noticing my tendency to
jump straight to solutions to solve problems quickly, rather than
slowing down to understand them first. Theories like Design Thinking
(Brown & Wyatt, 2010) and Lean Startup (Ries, 2011) helped me frame this
realization. They taught me: the most critical question in
entrepreneurship isn't “What should we build?” but “What matters most to
our target users?”

Looking back, I would approach the early stages of projects very
differently: less rushing, more listening. I would dedicate more time to
emotional mapping and trust-building, both with users and within the
team.

**Dealing with Challenges**

I witnessed moments when everyone nearly gave up, as communication
breakdowns seemed to drain our energy. Through this, I discovered my
natural role within the team: not the loudest voice, but the
coordinator, someone who creates calm amid chaos. I came to understand
that leadership often involves invisible work: listening, paraphrasing,
ensuring everyone is understood. This is the core strength that holds a
team together.

**Networks Built**

For me, the most unassuming success of this project lies in the network
it built. This wasn't typical “LinkedIn connections,” but genuine bonds
formed with classmates, mentors, survey participants, and customers:
exchanging entrepreneurial insights, offering advice, opening up to me,
and sharing authentic thoughts and experiences. These conversations
expanded my perspective beyond the project itself, gradually revealing
that entrepreneurship is not a solitary endeavor but a collaborative
ecosystem: a series of interconnected communities collectively nurturing
innovation. The value of these networks lies not in transactional
exchange, but in the emotional and intellectual support that sustained
me when motivation waned.

**II. New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills**

**Before and after the WIL**

Before taking this course, I believed I understood innovation. I could
define utility theory, map out a business model canvas, and discuss
“value propositions.” But these were all theories: logical, predictable,
yet disconnected from the chaotic human dimension of business.

In practice, I realized theory is like a map: it points the way but
doesn't help you set foot on the journey. The first few weeks felt like
navigating without a compass. Those terms like affordable loss, empathy
mapping, minimum viable product suddenly had to translate into action,
not just talk. That's when they truly came alive.

### 

**What Stood Out**

**Design Thinking: empathy as strategy**

Design Thinking (Brown & Wyatt, 2010) taught me that empathy isn't a
soft skill, it's a competitive advantage. Only when I truly began
listening to users, scrutinizing survey responses and capturing their
unspoken needs, I realized how often entrepreneurs impose their own
assumptions to others.

Empathy became the turning point for the project. It revealed that
loneliness doesn't stem solely from solitude; sometimes it arises from
insecurity and feeling overlooked in social settings. This subtle shift
in perspective completely altered the direction of all subsequent
product development. It also quietly reshaped how I view people: no
longer as “target users,” but as complex individuals with conflicting
needs.

**Lean Startup: learning to unlearn**

Lean Startup (Ries, 2011) forced me to unlearn perfectionism. I used to
equate success with getting it “perfect” on the first try. Now I see
progress as a series of controlled failures. The Build-Measure-Learn
cycle is not just a business method, it's a mindset.

Through low-cost, small-scale validation, I've learned to separate
myself from outcomes. A failed experiment isn't the end, it's data. This
shift in perspective has made me more resilient. Instead of asking “Why
did this fail?”, I now ask “What insights did I gain?”. This question
now permeates every aspect of my life.

**Effectuation: making something from almost nothing**

Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001) is the most enlightening concept I've
learned. As students with neither funds nor technical expertise, we had
to leverage every available resource: friends, free platforms and
borrowed skills to achieve our goals. I no longer see scarcity as a
shackle, but rather as fuel for creation.

The “affordable loss” principle gave me the courage to take small risks,
while the “crazy quilt ” principle reminded me that collaboration often
begins with trust, not contracts. Even unexpected challenges like team
conflicts or failed tests became what Sarasvathy (2001) calls “lemonade
moments”: transforming setbacks into learning opportunities.

**Skills That Stayed**

These frameworks provided direction, but what truly transformed me was
the shift that occurred on a personal level. I began learning how to
give sincere feedback without hurting others' feelings, how to detect
the unspoken in group discussions, and how to refrain from jumping to
conclusions.

Most importantly, I grasped the immense power of reflection. Journaling
has been a decade-long habit of mine, and through this course, I
discovered that the practice of documentation equally applies to
entrepreneurship and project development. It forces me to slow down,
understand genuine feelings, and view mistakes as part of the growth
process rather than flaws to be urgently fixed. Gradually, I stopped
rushing to find solutions and instead faced problems with stillness
until I truly understood their essence.

**Future: An Extension of This Journey**

This journey of integrating work and learning has reshaped my definition
of success. I once believed entrepreneurs must be bold disruptors; now I
see entrepreneurs as patient observers. I yearn to create projects that
tangibly improve people's lives, even through subtle yet lasting
changes.

I am particularly fascinated by cross-disciplinary frontiers: the
intersection of technology and psychology, the fusion of finance and
wellbeing, the union of innovation and empathy. Whether pursuing a
Master's in FinTech or founding a connection-driven social enterprise,
I'll uphold the same principles: start small, validate quickly, learn
continuously, and never forget the human-centered design at the core.

What surprised me most is that this journey reshaped not just my career
path, but my entire mindset. I no longer view uncertainty as a threat,
but as fertile ground for creativity. This shift in perspective is the
true degree I've earned.

**III. Course Feedback and Suggestions**

**What I Valued Most**

What struck me most about the WIL course was its authenticity. There was
not a trace of artificiality here. No predetermined outcomes, no perfect
teams, no ready-made success stories, only real people striving to
create within limited time and energy. This unadorned quality made it
one of the most genuine learning experiences I've ever had.

The integration of theory and practice proved remarkably effective. It
wasn't a simple “learn first, apply later” approach, but rather learning
through failure to grasp the value of theory. This method truly embedded
the theoretical framework. The reflective structure of the course was
equally invaluable. The journaling requirement forced me to capture
insights I might otherwise overlook, transforming chaos into clarity.

**Suggestions**

First, universities should provide more practical guidance on project
implementation. Offering short workshops on topics such as social media
promotion, event planning, and user testing or providing relevant
templates would make the entire process smoother and more grounded in
reality.

Second, despite receiving regular mentor guidance, most team members
struggled to formulate effective questions or maximize consultation
time. More structured discussion prompts or case studies of common
challenges faced by other teams would significantly enhance mentoring
efficiency.

Finally, I believe opportunities for cross-team collaboration or outcome
sharing should be increased. We only learned about other teams' progress
near the project's end. Drawing from peers' challenges and solutions
could spark new ideas while helping avoid common pitfalls.

Overall, I greatly admire the independence and creativity fostered by
this project, which has proven to be a valuable and confidence-building
experience.

**Five Reflective Diary Entries**

4/9/2025

Today we officially dove into our solutions phase, which was genuinely
exciting. Using the Crazy 8‘s method, our  team members generated a
total of 19 ideas! I noticed each person's ideas reflected our unique
style: my solutions focused on fun and engaging activities, Shanelle's
centered on common yet practical events, while Connor's solutions mostly
targeted introverted/activity-specific minority groups. Our minds
sparked brilliantly during the meeting, making it tough to decide where
to start. Before today, we applied many models and methods learned in
previous classes for theoretical analysis. This process deepened my
understanding and application of BMC, VPC, stakeholder analysis, the
iceberg model, and the How Might We formula. It felt truly amazing to
connect knowledge from different sources throughout this journey. 

After a day of deliberation, we decided to adopt Shanelle's Zoom Session
idea for our first MVP. This choice was driven both by her persistence
and the principle of Effectuation, as a student startup team, our
resources are extremely limited in every aspect. Our first MVP will work
like this: We'll promote our service across major social media platforms
to attract paid participants for our “Zoom Planning Session,” priced at
\$5 per session. We'll host a co-creation event where everyone
collaboratively plans the content and schedule for the entire upcoming
week's social activities. Then, we'll use the Partiful platform to send
activity confirmations and details to all participants, who will attend
independently. We'd also send regular email reminders to “maintain
friendships,” encouraging participants to deepen their bonds and stay
motivated for future events. We're finally ready to officially launch
this project, and we are really looking forward to it!

22/9/2025

We've finally entered the marketing phase. I've completed all the
different marketing materials tailored to distinct friend groups across
various platforms, sparking a lot of curiosity among friends. However,
this process also confirmed that our initial MVP truly lacked
differentiation (a point I repeatedly emphasized as crucial but was
overlooked), because most people felt they could attend similar events
for free (Meetup) or at a lower cost (clubs with \$5 monthly or
semi-annual fees). Others saw us as just another dating app, albeit a
campus version. (To be honest, we never focused on university campuses.
Though we repeatedly noted that the 18-24 demographic is more likely to
be found on campuses and as college students ourselves, we'd have an
advantage and convenience， but Shanelle overlooked this, likely due to
her time and distance constraints.)

Perhaps the team conflicts had been building up during these processes,
and today something unexpected finally erupted. I suddenly received an
email Shanelle had copied me on, unilaterally announcing she had removed
Connor from the team and kicked him out of the group chat. After
speaking with both of them separately, I learned the general reason:
Connor's task was to build an official website for the team (Shanelle
hadn't specified any requirements or expectations; whenever Connor
asked, her response was “up to you,” so he independently sourced web
development resources and methods, creating a charming and distinctive
page). After reviewing it, Shanelle expressed dissatisfaction, claiming
Connor hadn't adhered to her brand colors and that the result looked
unprofessional. Connor insisted he had asked her and received no
feedback, but she countered that such details “didn't need to be stated”
and promptly removed him from the team. I first realized the importance
of teamwork and communication.

25/9/2025

Today marks the launch of our first MVP. While it's exciting that we've
gained three paying users and generated \$15 in net profit, the results
unfortunately fell short of our expectations. Since we only have three
users, Shanelle and I decided to offer free access to some of our
closest friends. This experience highlighted the importance of having
supportive friends, even those uninterested in our project, they still
invested their valuable time and provided valuable feedback. At the
start of the meeting, Shanelle opened the PowerPoint to present our
project. I noticed a paying user left the meeting room when we reached
the second slide, and I suspect the presentation format made him feel
bored and pressured. So in the end, five people attended the planning
session (four of them are my friends). We invited everyone to join a
Facebook group for 14 rounds of voting on timing and activity content.
Throughout this period, I actively engaged in the chat to keep the
conversation flowing, privately messaged participants to address their
questions, and followed up on the process. The entire session lasted
about an hour and a half, and it was evident that everyone's enthusiasm
was gradually waning.

After the event concluded, we received only three valid responses
expressing interest in next week's activity. I immediately followed up
on all the feedback and suggestions from my friends, discovering that
everyone felt somewhat confused and overwhelmed. They had no idea who
they would be meeting, and the format involving PowerPoint presentations
and repeated voting left them feeling exhausted and bored. These three
valid responses later canceled their RSVPs on the Partiful platform. Our
first MVP was thus declared a failure. Following Lean Startup
principles, I proposed we should pivot as soon as possible,however
Shanelle questioned and opposed this idea.

11/10/2025

We decided to conduct the interviews through a questionnaire, which
enabled us to obtain a large number of high-quality samples. I collected
and analyzed 21 responses from our loneliness and social connection
survey. Reading the data felt like opening a mirror to our project
assumptions. I used to believe young people were deeply lonely and
needed structured emotional support, but the results surprised me—over
half of the respondents only sometimes feel lonely, and most are aged
18–24, our core audience. They don’t want therapy or commitment; they
just want something casual, fun, and safe. When asked how they cope with
loneliness, 67% said they use social media or talk to friends, while
only 43% attend social events. This taught me that while young people
crave connection, they also avoid socially demanding environments. Our
\$5 weekly session failed not because of cost, but because it didn’t
feel natural or emotionally safe. People wanted low-effort, themed, and
gamified activities (which confirms the ideas and thoughts I put forward
at the very beginning, but they were all dismissed at the time). 

The most important learning came from Design Thinking’s empathy stage:
listening to users reshaped my understanding of the real problem.
Loneliness isn’t just isolation, it’s discomfort in social spaces. Users
valued “trust and safety” (67%) and “matching with similar interests”
(43%) more than anything else. This realization pushed us to redesign
our drop-in model using Lean Startup principles, which test quickly,
learn, and pivot. We’ll now focus on creating theme-based, low-pressure
experiences that feel like friendship in progress. This process taught
me that empathy, not assumptions, drives innovation.

20/10/2025

After analysing our survey data and failed \$5 drop-in sessions, we
finally decided to pivot. Instead of trying to attract large groups to
casual events, we shifted toward small, consistent weekly gatherings.
The idea is to match about six people of similar age (we will still
focus on 18-24 olds this time) and interests, facilitate four themed
meetups, and help genuine friendships grow naturally over time. The
pivot came from realizing that users didn’t actually want “more events.”
They wanted belonging. The biggest insight was that people crave deeper
connections with fewer people and feel safer in smaller circles.
Applying Design Thinking, we moved from empathy to ideation, reframing
loneliness as a lack of emotional familiarity rather than a lack of
opportunities. We also used Lean Startup logic to redesign our
experiment. Each small group event is now a low-cost, low-risk
prototype: we’ll observe engagement, collect feedback, and iterate
weekly. Even the \$5 payment system through Stripe became a small way to
test user commitment without heavy barriers.

Looking back, that conflict taught me a lot about communication and
leadership. I realized that even when team roles are clear, expectations
are not always shared. As a result, I began scheduling brief check-ins
after each task to confirm progress and mutual understanding. Instead of
assuming everyone interpreted instructions the same way, I learned to
ask open-ended questions and invite feedback early. This simple change
improved collaboration and reduced misunderstandings in later stages of
our project. It also taught me the importance of empathy and
transparency when managing creative teams, sometimes clarity matters
more than control. This experience helped me grow from being a
participant to someone capable of facilitating teamwork under pressure.
