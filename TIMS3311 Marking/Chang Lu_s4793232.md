**CRITICAL REFLECTIVE ESSAY**

1.  **OVERALL WIL EXPERIENCE**

    This practical learning experience at WIL has given me a brand-new
    understanding of myself. It is not only an understanding of the
    knowledge level, but also includes an awareness of my own abilities
    such as teamwork and innovative thinking. As someone who is already
    quite interested in starting a business, I have gained more from
    this comprehensive practice.

    My first realization was that I was aware of the limitations of my
    students' thinking. On September 15th, when the mentor criticized
    our methodology as "too abstract", my first reaction was defensive,
    attempting to defend against the doubts by using the lean startup
    and design thinking frameworks that had already been adopted. But
    when I looked at our methodology from its perspective in reverse, I
    realized that I was using the complexity of theory to cover up the
    emptiness of execution. I said, "We will conduct problem
    interviews," but I didn't specify the exact 5W2H content. This
    reliance on abstract concepts actually reveals my habitual thinking
    as a student. I am good at understanding frameworks but not at
    transforming them into concrete actions. In fact, this coincides
    with the view that entrepreneurship education is regarded as a
    first-person transformation, that is, to cultivate a deeper
    self-awareness and entrepreneurial mindset in practice (Nzembayie &
    Coghlan, 2024). I realize that different external environments not
    only influence the facts themselves, but more importantly, they
    affect one's judgment from an objective position. The second
    cognition stems from a fixed understanding of language information.
    Once, due to my reliance on literature and records, I blindly
    believed in written and linguistic information. However, in the
    process of connection and communication, I became aware of the needs
    from different perspectives.

    My highlight moment was when I made a crucial discovery during the
    interview with Candle vendors at West End Markets. During the
    interview, I suddenly realized what we had been focusing on - the
    pain points of the organizers, because Sepal defined them as'
    customers'. But I suddenly realized that this was a two-sided market
    problem, and this moment also made me understand the essential
    difference between discovery and validation (Veisdal, 2020). In
    fact, the organizers want flexibility in booth allocation, and the
    stall owners want fixed locations. However, for the respondents, we
    have never asked, "What is the problem you most hope to solve?"
    Based on this, I redesigned the interviews and began to truly meet
    the needs of the stallholders. The difficult period is mainly
    concentrated from mid-September to late September. The biggest
    challenge is the low response rate of cold email. In fact, the
    online communication system hardly gets a response, while the
    subsequent face-to-face contact has achieved a success rate much
    higher than that of cold email. Therefore, we turned to on-site
    market research and successfully interviewed sixteen stallholders.

    Through this WIL, I established a relatively complex network
    structure. The first layer was the Sepal team. Through the initial
    meeting on August 20th and the two catch-ups on September 12th and
    17th, I not only understood the product vision but also gained
    insider knowledge about the market ecosystem. The second layer
    consists of eleven market organizer networks spanning Brisbane,
    Sydney and Tasmania, representing different operational models and
    market sizes. Cambridge's Bec taught me the complexity of
    large-scale market operations, while Bardon's Mitch enabled me to
    understand the trade-offs in small markets with limited resources.
    The third layer is a network of sixteen vendors, including
    Knittinggarden's cold start predicament, Candle vendors' market
    discovery demands, and Cookie Place's reliance on old customers.
    These diverse experiences enabled me to understand heterogeneity on
    the demand side (Zegwaard et al., 2023).

2.  **NEW KNOWLEDGA, INSIGHTS AND SKILLS**

At the beginning of the course, my understanding of the entrepreneurial
methodology was completely at the theoretical level. In fact, the
previous learning enabled me to explain the concepts of
"Build-measurement-learning cycle" and "customer development" fluently.
I also knew that Design Thinking has five stages. But actually, I don't
know how to operationalize these theories. This is also the reason why I
can write a good methodological framework but it cannot be applied. I
still don't know how to recruit respondents, how to avoid selling in
interviews, and how to handle contradictory information. It can be said
that my starting point was more stuck in traditional perception,
believing that starting a business mainly relies on detailed
pre-planning and intuitive decision-making, and I felt confused about
how to act effectively in an uncertain environment.

However, through practice, I realized the first key learning and gained
the realization that empathy in design thinking requires immersion
rather than imagination. This concept impressed me deeply because it
offers a people-oriented, solution-oriented approach to entrepreneurship
and innovation, which has completely transformed the way I solve
problems, especially its emphasis on the core elements of "empathy" and
"prototyping". In fact, it can understand real problems through empathy
and combine creativity for innovation and rapid prototyping tests to
verify feasibility (Kabir, 2021). Before getting involved in design
thinking, I believed that empathy meant "thinking from the user's
perspective", and I thought that I could "empathize" through research.
But actually this understanding is cerebral and imaginative, which was
obvious in the early stages of the project that we chose the wrong
interview approach, And the results of the interview are actually based
on the fact that we did not truly understand the tedious nature behind
it. This change in perception led me to conduct multiple rounds of user
interviews and observations in the subsequent process to understand the
emotions and needs of the target users. In my opinion, the prominent
feature of design thinking lies in that it offers a non-linear path of
innovation, guiding us to constantly diverge and converge, and avoiding
getting trapped in rigid plans too early. Today, many entrepreneurship
educations still tend to focus on linear programming and writing
business plans, lacking sufficient exploration of initial problems
(Tselepis & Lavelle, 2020). I have personally experienced that design
thinking offers a paradigm shift. Compared with predicting and
presetting goals, it encourages us to embrace uncertainty and discover
new opportunities through continuous experimentation (Tselepis &
Lavelle, 2020). From the perspective of career development in
entrepreneurship, design thinking is the ability to perceive problems
from the perspective of stakeholders, think creatively and quickly make
mistakes. It will greatly enhance the effectiveness and innovation of
work (Kabir, 2021).

The second key learning I realized was that I understood that
constructing measurement learning is a discovery mechanism rather than a
proof tool. The reason why this idea impressed me is that it
fundamentally changed my understanding of the relationship between
assumptions and data, especially the core elements of "quick trial and
error" and "data-driven decision-making" it emphasizes. In fact, it can
counteract the confirmation bias in human nature through a systematic
experimental process, enabling innovators to quickly identify and polish
promising ideas to make them truly effective (Cook et al., 2023).
Previously, I thought the purpose of research was to prove things. I
believed that hypotheses could be verified by collecting supporting
evidence. But in fact this understanding is linear and
validation-oriented. This misconception was obvious in the early stage
of the project that we chose the wrong research target. The result of
the interview was actually obtained on the basis that we did not truly
understand the nature that "discovering mistakes is more valuable than
proving correctness". This change in perception led me to view each
interview in the subsequent process as an experiment to test hypotheses
rather than a tool to seek supporting evidence. In my opinion, the
prominent feature of lean startup lies in its provision of an
operational verification framework, guiding us from building testable
hypotheses to measuring real data and then to learning and adjusting,
thus avoiding the waste of resources in the wrong direction. However, I
also realize that lean startup overly emphasizes timely satisfaction of
users' current feedback, which may lead innovation to remain at gradual
improvement rather than breakthrough change (Felin et al., 2020). If
only immediate data is focused on, entrepreneurs may fall into the trap
of "only doing what users say they want". Thus missing the opportunity
for disruptive innovation (Felin et al., 2020).

The third new knowledge I realized is that the lemonade principle of
effect reasoning transforms constraints into sources of innovation. The
reason why this idea impressed me is that it fundamentally changed my
understanding of failure and unexpected events, especially the core
elements it emphasizes - "acceptable loss", "patchwork quilt" and
"lemonade principle". In fact, it can transform seemingly negative
surprises into triggers for exploring new paths by flexibly responding
to uncertainties. Entrepreneurs can define in advance the losses they
can bear, boldly try new ideas, and at the same time keep the cost of
failure to a minimum (Bosatto & Lima, 2023). Denis of Carrara Markets
refused to be interviewed but provided insights into the "value of
interpersonal interaction". The rejection in large markets helped us
discover that the medium-sized market is the real target customer. The
unexpected feedback from the vendor revealed the greater opportunity of
market discovery. These moments are concrete manifestations of turning
lemons into lemonade.Whenever a hypothesis was overthrown, it will
become a fulcrum of the evidence, rather than a personal failure. From
the perspective of entrepreneurial career development, effect reasoning
can maintain flexibility and psychological resilience in a business
environment full of uncertainties. This will greatly enhance the ability
to respond to risks reasonably and integrate resources effectively
(Bosatto & Lima, 2023).This positive attitude and innovative way of
thinking will help me to face challenges more calmly in my future career
and explore innovative opportunities in a controlled way.

**REFLECTIVE DIARY ENTRIES 01**

Today is September 15th. The consultation with Jack changed my
understanding of the methodology. When he pointed out that our plan at
that time was too abstract, I thought we had adopted the framework of
lean startup and design thinking, which should have been sufficient. But
since I said so, I also thought it over. Suddenly, I realized that I had
been using the complexity of theory to cover up the emptiness of
execution.We wrote that we would conduct questions-based interviews, but
we did not specify when, who, or what questions to use. This exposed my
thinking habits as a student. I'm good at understanding frameworks, but
not at translating them into concrete actions.This realization made me
uncomfortable because it revealed that I had been hiding behind academic
language, using abstract concepts to escape the uncertainty of facing
reality. I'm beginning to understand why many students fail in their
entrepreneurial endeavors. It's not because of a lack of theoretical
knowledge, but because there is a huge gap between theory and practice,
and I had never truly crossed this gap before. That night, I and they
reworked the plan, detailing the number of interviews to be completed
each week, the list of markets to be contacted, and the specific
questions to be asked. This process was very painful because it required
me to admit that my previous work was not enough, but at the same time I
also realized that this might be a crucial turning point for me to shift
from a student's mindset to that of an entrepreneur. This process made
me realize that my reliance on theory was actually an escape. I needed
to translate every methodological concept into specific things to do, no
longer content with knowing what the theory was, but to prove that I
could carry it out.

**REFLECTIVE DIARY ENTRIES 02**

Today is September 22nd. The Ari call with Kirribilli Markets was a
deeply frustrating experience. At that time, he told me that their
system had been launched and was fully functional in 2022. I felt that
the foundation of our entire assumption collapsed in an instant. What
made me more uncomfortable was his counter-question, "Do you have a
better website?" This question not only exposed our ignorance of the
current situation of large-scale market operations, but also made me
realize that we have been guiding research with an outdated assumption.
But since it has come to this, I have also reflected on it. I took the
result of this interview as a denial of my personal ability, as if I had
done something wrong that led to this outcome. A few days later,
reflection made me realize that this was a critical cognitive error.
Assuming that being overturned by data was not a personal failure, but a
core process of validated learning. Kirribilli's rejection is actually a
valuable data point, which tells us that the large market is not the
target customer of Sepal, and this helps us conduct market segmentation.
This experience exposed that my tolerance for failure was far lower than
I had imagined. I need to separate my ego from my idea and learn to view
the overthrow of assumptions as progress rather than setback. That
night, my team and I discussed all the collected data, from Bardon's
Excel to Jan Powers' manual adjustment. The pattern began to emerge. The
small and medium-sized market is the segment that really needs help.

On September 27th, that moment when I interviewed the Candle vendor at
West End Markets today changed my understanding of the difference
between discovery and validation. At that time, she said she hoped there
would be an app that could list all the local markets and open stalls.
Suddenly, I realized that we had been asking the wrong questions all
along. Our interview scripts are all designed around the four pain
points hypothesized by Sepal. We are verifying the preset answers rather
than truly discovering the users' needs. But since we have all
discovered it, I have also reflected on it, because we thought we were
conducting problem interviews and practicing lean startup, but in fact,
we were looking for evidence to support our assumptions with
confirmation bias. This conversation exposed my misunderstanding about
the nature of problem interviews. I thought it was enough not to sell
solutions, but I overlooked that the problem itself could also be
preconceived. On my way back, I kept reflecting. If I had asked you from
the very beginning if you thought there was a problem with the
reservation process, the vendor might have said it was okay, because her
real pain point was not in the reservation at all, but in market
discovery. That night, I redesigned the last question of the follow-up
interview. I changed it from how you would like to improve the booking
process to what you would like to change if it could make doing business
easier. This process has enabled me to deeply understand the value of
discovery. It is not about verifying what you already know, but about
uncovering what you don't. And these unknowns are often more valuable
than your assumptions. This minor adjustment has opened up a completely
different space for dialogue, allowing users to express needs we have
never thought of.

**REFLECTIVE DIARY ENTRIES 04**

I received an email today from Denis of Carrara Markets refusing to be
interviewed. My initial reaction was disappointment and depression.At
the time, he said that his 50 years of experience was valuable IP and
would not be shared for free. He also criticized us for trying to reduce
human interaction with digitalization. I think this email is a failed
cold one, a lost data point. But since I was rejected all of them, I
also reflected on it. A few days later, when I reread this email, I
began to realize that Dennis actually provided very important insights,
even though he had declined a formal interview. His criticism of
reducing interpersonal communication is not only a reason for rejection,
but also points out the fundamental blind spot of our entire research
method. We have always analyzed the market as a trading platform where
vendors book stalls and organizers manage reservations. But what Denis
said is that the market is a social ecosystem, and the value created by
interpersonal relationships and personal judgments cannot be replaced by
algorithms. That night I reinterpreted some of the comments from the
previous interview puzzling, why Fitzroy said booth allocation was an
art, and why Cambridge emphasized keeping some human steps. This process
enabled me to understand the true meaning of the lemonade principle in
effect reasoning. A rejection or setback, if correctly understood, often
provides deeper insights than a smooth interview. I also began to
question my own definition of a successful interview, that is, getting
the expected answer is considered a success. It was still a success to
obtain unexpected insights. Denis' unsolicited critique provided me with
a framework to interpret these scattered observations.

**REFLECTIVE DIARY ENTRIES 05**

Today, when I organized the data from 27 interviews into a comparison
table, I went through a transformation process from scattered
observations to coherent insights. At that time I made a Sepal's Assumed
Pain Points versus Actual Findings table, and the result was very stark.
Pain Point 1 Regarding real-time booking, none of the eleven organizers
mentioned it as a priority, but Cambridge mentioned that hundreds of
daily emails were the biggest pain point. Pain Point 2 Regarding product
quotas, they do exist, but they require manual judgment rather than
complete automation. Pain Point 3 regarding compliance tracking exists
but is not the most urgent. Pain Point 4 about cancellations is hardly a
problem. But since everything has been sorted out and I have reflected
on it, at the same time, there emerged Pain Point 5, market discovery,
which we never preset. The two stallholders explicitly requested, but
the actual demand might be higher because our problem design was not
targeted at this. This synthesis process made me understand what it
means to let the data speak rather than let the hypotheses speak. I
observed the pattern, the frequency, and the true order of priorities,
all of which are significantly different from our initial assumptions.
That night, I deeply realized the integrity of the Build-Measure-Learn
loop. We built the hypothesis, we Measured the reality, and now we must
Learn and pivot. This process made me understand why Lean startup
emphasizes rapid experimentation. If we start building the product
before completing all the interviews, we will be investing a lot of
resources in the wrong direction. These twenty-seven interviews are not
validation but discovery. We did not prove that Sepal was right. We have
discovered what different things Sepal should do. RetryClaude can make
mistakes. Please double-check responses.
