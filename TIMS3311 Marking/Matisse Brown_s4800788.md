Part 1: Reflective Diary Entries

1st Entry:

During my WIL project’s first few weeks, I definitely experienced more
challenges than I anticipated. I set out with a clear objective of
validating my SwingIQ concept by interviewing golfers with various
backgrounds and experiences. However, finding individuals outside of my
personal network proved to be more difficult than expected. To jumpstart
the research process, I was able to leverage work colleagues as
candidates for my interviews. This was the first group of people I
interviewed which took place during lunch breaks or after work. This was
initially a somewhat uncomfortable experience; I was concerned about
interrupting their day or appearing unprofessional. As my manager was
also away for that week, I was covering additional work processes, so
time was limited in terms of finding gaps that I could leverage.

One error I encountered during this first week of interviews was
forgetting to record a whole interview with my college Dean, and instead
accidentally timed it on my phone, I thought maybe this was due to
focusing on keeping the conversation informal and having enough time to
collect some valuable insights. I only remembered when I went to
transcribe the feedback. This oversight was a learning experience, and I
took measures to be better prepared and not make silly mistakes that
could easily been avoided if more organised with time. I began preparing
short question guides and ensured that I captured notes or voice memos
following each conversation.

Looking back on this stage, I identified effectuation’s Bird-in-Hand
principle. I used the means already available to me by capitalising on
my network of colleagues instead of waiting for ideal participants to
come along. It was a valuable lesson in starting with what I have in the
journey. By the end of the week, not only had I gathered useful insights
about amateur and experienced golfers’ practice approaches, but I had
also developed a better balance between professional commitments and
entrepreneurial curiosity. This experience enhanced my persistence,
organisation, and ability to recognise existing resources in more
creative ways.

2nd Entry:

During the second week of conducting data, I decided to pushed myself
outside my comfort zone. I went to the local driving range to observe
golfers and try to conduct casual interviews. It took me a bit amount of
time to build the courage to approach a young guy named Sam, practicing
alone. I explained I was doing a university project and asked if he’d
answer a few quick questions. He seemed to be somewhat genuinely
interested and happy to share his experiences.

That interaction changed my perspective. I made me realise that people
are often willing to help if you approach them respectfully and show
genuine curiosity. The conversation gave me new insights that differed
from my earlier interviews with colleagues, he mentioned struggling with
inconsistency and wanting “feedback that feels human, not as robotic.”
This was a valuable design insight that later shaped my thinking about
the app’s tone and user experience.

This moment reflected the Design Thinking “Empathise” stage, moving
beyond surface assumptions to understand people’s real motivations and
frustrations. I also discovered a new confidence in myself. Approaching
a stranger which can be somewhat intimidating at first, but the success
of that first conversation made me realise it wasn’t nearly as hard as I
imagined.

I saw It was a breakthrough in both my personal and professional
development. I learned that effective entrepreneurship relies on empathy
and listening first then designing second. I left the range that day not
just with new data, but with a stronger belief in my ability to connect
with people.

Diary Entry 3:

During one of my observation sessions at the range, I need to record a
few golfers’ swings to analyse technique differences and identify
potential motion patterns that my app could later assess. I tried to
film discreetly, thinking it was harmless since I wasn’t sharing the
footage publicly, although it did feel somewhat weird filming someone
whilst they were unaware of it.

When I reflected on this experience, I connected it to the Lean Startup
Build Measure Learn cycle. I had instinctively built a small experiment
to learn something quickly but I overlooked the “measure responsibly”
element. I had been focused on testing assumptions that I neglected
ethical considerations. This taught me that real-world testing is not
just about speed, but also about accountability and integrity.

The exercise did reveal something valuable as I noticed that between the
three golfers they all had unique posture tendencies, reinforcing that a
“one-size-fits-all” model wouldn’t work. SwingIQ would need to tailor
its coaching suggestions to individual playing styles. Still, I
recognised that I could have gathered this insight more ethically
through consented footage which would’ve obviously meant that I’d have
to ask permission to film someone.

This incident reinforced a personal learning experience; innovation
isn’t just about being resourceful but also about being responsible.
Mistakes are part of the entrepreneurial journey, but acknowledging them
early helped me to shape more ethical and sustainable practices for
moving forward.

Diary Entry 4:

To expand my data, I organised interviews with three close friends who
all play golf regularly. We met up one afternoon, and I asked each of
them similar questions about their habits, motivations, and whether
they’d pay for an app like SwingIQ. I quickly realised all three gave
pretty identical answers so they preferred playing socially, relied on
YouTube and tiktok for guidance initially, and wouldn’t pay for a
coaching app.

At first, I was frustrated that the data wasn’t diverse enough to be
useful. However, as I analysed their responses, I noticed that they all
represented a common type of golfer being self-taught, social, and not
overly competitive. This helped me identify a clearer target segment for
SwingIQ. My app might not appeal to this group, but it could provide
value to more independent players who practice alone and seek
self-improvement.

This experience aligned with the Effectuation “Crazy Quilt” principle. I
realised that not every contact needs to become a customer as some help
refine understanding of who isn’t the target market. My friends feedback
effectively acted as negative validation, which was just as valuable as
positive confirmation.

Through this, I also learned the importance of broadening interview
pools beyond my immediate social circle. Entrepreneurship requires
stepping beyond comfortable networks to capture a market perspective.
This moment sharpened my ability to analyse customer data critically and
guided my decision to narrow SwingIQ’s focus to a more specific and
motivated niche.

5th Entry:

In one of the later stages of the project, I wanted to expand my
research beyond my immediate network and reach out to the broader golf
community. I crafted a professional email to a local club in Nudgee. I
made sure it sounded credible and sent it off although a passed with no
response. This was frustrating, and honestly a bit discouraging,
especially after spending so much time trying to get genuine engagement.

This experience taught me a lot about the realities of entrepreneurship.
I recognised Effectuation’s Lemonade Principle in action, turning
surprises or setbacks into learning opportunities. Instead of giving up
I instead pivoted my strategy. I went back to what had worked before
being the in-person interactions. I focused on conducting more
face-to-face interviews through personal connections. While it wasn’t as
scalable, the conversations were richer and provided more authentic
insights.

Overall this moment strengthened my persistence and adaptability. I
learned that rejection or low engagement doesn’t mean failure but more
so just signals the need to adjust the approach. Entrepreneurship is
also about resilience as it is about innovation, and this experience
reminded me to stay more flexible and resourceful when plans don’t go
the way I hoped.

Part 2: Critical Reflection Essay

Before I began my WIL journey with SwingIQ, I thought that coming up
with a new venture idea would be the most challenging part as I knew I
wanted to do something I was passionate about and could show genuine
interest in it. But I quickly discovered that the real work was in
validating that idea with real people in real life contexts. The first
few weeks were spent trying to conduct interviews with golfers of all
skills. This proved to be more difficult than anticipated. The first
practical lesson I learned was that entrepreneurship runs alongside real
life and that time pressure isn’t a side issue but more so the setting.
Early on, I forgot to record an interview, which pushed me to build
better habits, a short question guide, immediate post-interview notes,
and a clearer setup for each conversation.

A highlight of the experience was deliberately stepping outside my
comfort zone to approach golfers at the driving range. I was initially
anxious, but framing the conversation as user research made it more
natural, and I learned something about myself which was once I anchor a
difficult task to a clear purpose, my confidence follows. One person
noted that while existing apps aren’t inherently “bad,” their feedback
often feels robotic and lacks the sense of coachability that a human
provides. That insight, combined with my own growth in initiating
conversations, shifted my focus from chasing raw metrics to designing an
experience with the right tone, framing, and explainability.

A consistent challenge was balancing the project with work and finding
reliable windows to run interviews. Early on, ad-hoc outreach kept
slipping when days got busy, so I built a simple scheduling routine
which was a diary with set interview days. For example, Tuesdays at
lunch I would interview this person and so on and then I would set a
weekly target for other conversations. I blocked these times in my
calendar, listed who I would contact each week, and prepared a short
guide and consent script the night before to reduce friction. This
structure turned from saying “I’ll try to fit it in” into clear
commitments I could keep up throughout my experience. It also improved
the quality of my data because I arrived prepared and focused, rather
than rushed. The process taught me practical time management and
planning ahead as well as protecting small but consistent time slots
which ultimately helped me sustain momentum and deliver the project to a
better standard.

In hindsight, I would hard block this structure from day one meaning I’d
reserve inflexible interview times in my calendar for the entire
semester, create lead time around known high-workload phases, and
over-recruit to mitigate the impact of people who couldn’t
accommodate. I’d also draft a reusable outreach template and a one-page
interview guide in advance so every session was efficient. Finally, I’d
create a simple weekly checklist (who I’m contacting, when I’m
interviewing, what I’m changing based on last week’s insights) to make
my momentum more visible. Had I worked this way from the start, I would
have mitigated any of my scheduling anxiety, collected richer data
earlier, and made faster and more cleaner decisions.

The three frameworks that changed my practice were Design Thinking, Lean
Startup, and Effectuation, not so much as labels but more so as
operating habits. Design Thinking stood out to me because it turned “be
user-centred” into a concrete method. Shifting my interviews to
story-led prompts such as “Walk me through your last practice and what
were you trying to fix?”, revealed that many golfers define progress as
one actionable improvement in the same session. That insight became a
design rule for SwingIQ, giving one clear cue, add a brief “why it
matters” explanation, and showing examples that match the player’s
style, so in other words, build explainability into the product.
Practising this through Design Thinking (empathy) and Lean Startup
(small tests) taught me how to turn vague needs into simple, actionable
guidance. This carries directly into my career, I feel more confident
running empathy-led conversations, asking story-based questions, and
then communicating next steps in plain language whether that’s on the
phone or in person with clients. I relate it to the same “coach-like”
tone users wanted in SwingIQ which is less dashboard and more guidance
like.

Overall throughout my experience, lean Startup helped me stop
over-polishing and instead run small Build Measure Learn cycles. I ran a
concierge MVP by manually reviewing swings and sending tailored notes,
then tagged every session with the same fields, goals, current
workaround, and willingness to pay. That instrumentation forced real
decisions instead of vague impressions. For example, when a cluster of
participants consistently said they wouldn’t pay, I treated it as
negative validation and pivoted toward players who practise
intentionally and value personalised guidance. The point for me isn’t
the golf context but more so the loop. I built a condensed test,
measured a handful of concrete outcomes, and learned which audience,
message, and feature emphasis actually mattered. Keeping a simple
evidence log turned opinions into a visible decision trail and made
subsequent recommendations defensible because I could show exactly what
changed and why.  
  
Effectuation helped me start with what I had and allowed me to recover
quickly from setbacks. Bird-in-Hand legitimised starting with what I
already had which was nearby contacts, access to a range, and my own
skills so momentum didn’t depend on ideal conditions. Affordable Loss
kept my experiments small and safe by favouring manual feedback over
premature software builds that are harder to obtain and access. Using
Lemonade, I treated setbacks such as unanswered emails as signals to
switch my format which led me to do more in-person discovery. I also
used Crazy Quilt partnering by treating mentors and informed insiders,
even if they weren’t end users, those relationships helped refine
assumptions and timing. When something fell over, the lemonade mindset
meant harvesting the learning, objection patterns, timing issues and
scope gains into the next iteration instead of starting from zero.

What changed me most in this WIL wasn’t one big win but more so learning
a better way to work. I tried to stopped pitching and started listening
more. By Using Design Thinking, I asked golfers to talk me through a
real practice so what they tried, what felt clumsy and what actually
helped. Hearing those stories made the brief more obvious which was
people want one thing they can try right now and a simple reason it
might work. The Lean Startup allowed me to have a rhythm so Instead of
polishing, I ran small tests, set two or three signs of success upfront,
and forced a decision after each round. I started with what I had and
kept bets small (time and effort I could afford). Mentors and helpful
insiders became part of my crazy quilt nudging my timing and tone in
better directions.

Because of that, I am able work differently now meaning I can open a
conversation with genuine curiosity, turn needs into something I can
actually test, and explain my next step in plain language. I’m more
comfortable with proposing a small pilot instead of a big promise,
showing the evidence behind my recommendation. That mix of Design
Thinking (hear what people really need), Lean Startup (prove it in small
steps), and Effectuation (move forward with the resources I have) is
what I’ll aim to keep using in client-facing roles in current and future
carers. It’s made me overall more confident, more practical, and better
at earning trust.

What I valued most from this course was the way the lecturer combined
support being present, engaged, and kept challenging us to do our best.
What stood out was the course design pushed me into real, face-to-face
work rather than staying behind a screen. That practical emphasis
through talking to people, negotiating, handling awkward moments, and
turning messy conversations into insight felt like a more real-world
situation and made the learning easier to obtain. To strengthen the
unit, I’d suggest first, more space between Assessment 2 and 3 so
there’s more time to act on feedback and improve the final submission,
provide concise lecture notes/slides in addition to recordings so key
ideas are faster to find and revise and add a short, low-stakes peer
feedback session halfway through the placemen or Getting another
student’s perspective on our diary entries or research direction which
could highlight blind spots and help refine our approach before the
final reflection.
