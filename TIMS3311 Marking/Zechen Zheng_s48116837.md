## **Critical Reflection Essay**

### 

### **1) The overall WIL experience**

In addition to attending monthly Zoom meetings with Lili Grace
Foundation founder Chipo and partner Doris, I gained first-hand
experience with international, impact-oriented MVP testing. Five honest
problems shaped my learning curve:

**1.Under-prepared meetings → unclear direction.** Sometimes I joined
without reading carefully, so goals were repeated and decisions were
delayed.

**2.Language pace.** I was unable to keep up with Chipo and Doris due to
my limited English ability, which caused me to miss cues and ask for
follow-ups later on.

**3.Late alignment on MVPs.** As a result of working in isolation for
too long, the team was slowed by my late sharing of drafts.

**4.No prior experience.** The term "impact + transparency" was new to
me, and I hadn't worked on cause-driven A/B testing.

**5.Low confidence.** As long as I wasn't sure, I kept silent-silence
that appeared to be agreement.

It was important for me to turn each pain point into a working practice.
To ensure understanding, I used BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) agendas,
three bullet points, and timed decisions for meetings. At the end of
each meeting, I also requested a two-minute recap. To maintain language
pace, I used live captions and pre-wrote key sentences. For MVPs, I
posted work in progress screenshots 24 hours before meetings. For
experience gaps, I used hypothesis templates. To gain confidence, I
started with "tentative view + what would change my mind." By utilizing
these small mechanics, I was able to reduce anxiety and increase speed.

**Highlights and difficult times**

The highlight was shipping four MVP ads in Canva: A1 (story-driven:
Chipo and her child) and A4 (impact &amp; transparency). A low point was
my early copy implying Chipo had T1D; the patient is her child. I
learned to slow down, confirm facts aloud, and design consent-first
workflows after correcting that error. It also taught me to value
specificity (names, dates, counts, definitions) over "moving language."

**Networks and value**

Featuring partners and footnotes wasn't decoration; it anchored claims
to reality. LGF connected me to the Midlands Diabetes Impact Group
(MDIG) and Insulin for Life Australia. As an example, we reached 80
beneficiaries at the Gweru clinic in May 2025 by providing free medical
and mental-health consultations, screenings, and education, as well as
insulin donated by Insulin for Life Australia. By writing this on a
clean card with a clear data period and definition footnote, the message
was trustworthy and honest.

**What I would do differently**

To speak more confidently, I would (a) pre-arrange decision thresholds
before testing (see Section 2B), (b) schedule fixed weekly check-ins,
and (c) request pronunciation guides for Zimbabwean partner names.

## **2) New Knowledge, Insights & Skills**

As I began this placement, I viewed a powerful story as if it were
already an answer. Working with the Lili Grace Foundation encouraged me
to separate empathy from claims, allowing empathy to frame the problem
instead of replacing evidence. During the conversation with Chipo about
her child’s near-miss encounter with Type 1 diabetes in Zimbabwe, I felt
compelled to center a narrative about parents and children. It forced me
to translate that feeling into a falsifiable question: prospective
donors are moved by the story, but they still doubt the story's
credibility; how might we combine story with proof to increase both
click-through rate and trust? Once the question was clear, prototyping
stopped being decoration and became a controlled test. I set a fixed
scaffold—logo, CTA, trust line, footnote format, and type tokens—so that
the narrative layer was the only variable. The A1 prototype foregrounded
the story (Chipo and her child); the A4 prototype emphasized impact and
transparency (the May 2025 Gweru clinic with 80 beneficiaries, free
consultations/screening/education, insulin via Insulin for Life
Australia, MDIG/SolidaMed partners, with definitions and period). As a
result of that discipline, I developed my first reliable insight: A1
tends to lift CTR and A4 tends to lift perceived trust. Thus, the
"solution" became a synthesis based on evidence, not taste.

My practice was reshaped by Lean Startup's emphasis on
Build-Measure-Learn as a rhythm, not a slogan. With 24-hour shippable
cycles, I instrumented every variant with UTM parameters, and designed a
survey that forced a choice (“most persuasive”), captured Trust Likert
scores and Action Intent, and then asked for qualitative texture by
asking “Why?” Most importantly, I pre-registered a threshold so that
meetings would end in decisions: A4 would only advance if ≥70% of
respondents rated it “trustworthy/very trustworthy,” with n≈20–30 per
round. In the first week, lacking such a gate, we debated endlessly;
once the threshold existed, debates collapsed into outcomes. Feedback
also triggered a presentation pivot rather than a proposition pivot:
people asked “where do these numbers come from?” or missed the CTA. In a
small, reversible pivot, we moved data period + definitions above the
fold, enlarged the CTA, and added a partners line.

The context of a cross-border nonprofit made Effectuation seem more
natural than expected. While I didn't have perfect English or deep NGO
growth experience, I had the ability to make decisions by affordable
loss and weave a crazy quilt of allies around me. Capping each test at
n≈20–30 gave me a rule for “enough to decide,” which lowered the anxiety
of not having perfect data. By naming partners-MDIG, Insulin for Life
Australia, SolidaMed-inside the creative and footnotes, alliances became
verifiable anchors rather than mere logos. Even my early
mistake—implying Chipo herself had T1D rather than her child—became
lemonade: consent-first workflows, precision language, and a standard
footnote (“Period: Jan-Aug 2025. The beneficiaries are attendees
receiving consults, screenings, and education. The insulin was donated
by Insulin for Life Australia. ), as well as a "risk lexicon" of words
to avoid and safer alternatives. As I learned, transparency is not a
disclaimer, but a feature that reduces cognitive friction while
emphasizing the story's dignity.

Despite my weaknesses in preparation, pace, and confidence, these
frameworks only worked when I paired them with operational scaffolding.
In my meetings, I used BLUF pre-reads, timeboxing, and a one-minute
recap that restated decisions, owners, and dates. In written
communication, SBAR emails allow me to be brief and polite yet decisive:
Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation. I prepared "one
recommendation, one risk, and one alternative" and vowed to speak them
aloud before each call. It was structure that provided me with the
ability to make decisions, regardless of how slowly words flowed.

What made these ideas stand out? Because they turned vague anxiety into
repeatable, small systems. By using Design Thinking, I was able to ask
the right questions and devised a discipline for prototyping one change
at a time. The Lean Startup taught me how to turn talk into choices
through instrumentation, thresholds, and reversible pivots. As my
effectuation taught me, when resources, time, and certainty are limited,
there is little that can be done to move with integrity. My five pain
points - underprepared meetings, falling behind the English pace, late
MVP alignment, lack of prior experience, and low confidence - were
converted into habits that could be applied across contexts.

As a result, my definition of "quality" has changed. I define a good ad
as one that survives a controlled comparison and still respects ethics.
It matters for my future career because I now have a portable way to
operate in growth or PMM: develop an empathy-informed, falsifiable
problem statement; ship single-variable prototypes at a tight cadence;
instrument outcomes with UTMs and short surveys; decides by pre-agreed
thresholds; pivot presentation before proposition; keep alliances
visible as proof; and treat transparency as an integral part of the
product. Possibly the most subtle change is how I judge meetings:
Instead of judging them by the minutes they were discussed, I now
measure them by the decisions made. Keeping that metric in mind keeps me
honest-about my preparation, my language, and my responsibility to move
work forward.

## **Diary Entry 1 — Under-prepared meeting, fuzzy direction** **What happened**

## On my first Zoom with Chipo and Doris, I arrived without a tight pre-read. I had scattered notes, no clear decision request, and my questions mixed empathy (“How do families feel?”) with execution (“Which ad do we make first?”). The conversation loops—story vs. transparency—repeated for 40 minutes. When the call ended, nobody owned the next step. I also hesitated to clarify names and dates, worried my English would slow everyone down.

**What I learned**

I reframed the brief using Design Thinking: Prospective donors are moved
by the parent–child story yet still question credibility; how might we
combine story and proof to increase both click and trust? To fix my
preparation gap, I adopted BLUF one-pager pre-reads (Goal, Options,
Decisions Needed, Risks, Next Steps), timeboxing for each topic, and a
two-minute recap I deliver at the end. I also wrote one assertive,
simple sentence in advance (“Today I propose we test story vs.
transparency as separate MVPs”) so I would actually speak up.

**Why it matters**

My metric for a “good meeting” shifted from minutes spoken to decisions
made. This structure reduced my anxiety about English pace and gave the
team a stable problem frame for prototyping. It also set a respectful
tone: clarity is kindness. With a sharper brief, I could build
prototypes that test a single idea instead of pitching a fuzzy bundle of
ideas that wastes everyone’s time.

## **Diary Entry 2 — Falling behind the English pace** **What happened**

## On the second call the dialogue moved faster. I understood the content, but I couldn’t respond quickly. I missed cues about timelines and sent several follow-up emails, which delayed the team. My long, polite messages—natural in Chinese—looked vague in English. I felt I was “nice but unclear,” which is the worst combination for remote work.

**What I learned**

I adopted two tools. First, SBAR for messages: Situation (what’s
happening), Background (context), Assessment (my view), Recommendation
(my ask). Second, I requested a recap minute at the end of calls:
“Here’s my understanding: X by Friday; I own Y; open risks are Z. Did I
miss anything?” I also turned on live captions and prepared tentative
lines such as, “Tentative view: surface two MVPs this week; I’ll change
my mind if we confirm partner constraints.”

**Why it matters**

These micro-structures protected clarity without demanding perfect
English. They also link to Lean Startup: SBAR delivers crisp
recommendations; the recap minute converts talk into a small backlog. My
confidence rose because I had scripts that were polite, short, and
actionable. The team responded faster, which encouraged me to keep
speaking. I learned that when language feels like a barrier, structure
becomes a prosthetic—it lets ideas move even when words are slow.

## **Diary Entry 3 — MVP rework from late sharing** **What happened**

## I built the A1 (story) and A4 (transparency) ads too far in isolation before showing the team. Feedback was valuable but required multiple large edits. I realized my “wait until it looks good” habit was slowing everyone. We also debated design choices because our variables weren’t controlled.

**What I learned**

I switched to Lean Startup’s Build–Measure–Learn with single-variable
prototypes. I created a fixed scaffold (logo, CTA, trust line, footnote
style) and varied only the narrative (story vs. transparency). Every
version carried UTM parameters. The survey had (i) a forced choice for
“most persuasive,” (ii) a Trust Likert score, (iii) an Action Intent
item, and (iv) a “Why?” textbox. I posted WIP screenshots 24 hours ahead
so teammates could comment early. Most importantly, we pre-registered a
threshold: A4 advances only if ≥70% of respondents rate it
“trustworthy/very trustworthy,” with n ≈ 20–30 per round.

**Why it matters**

Early sharing plus single-variable control reduced rework and arguments.
The threshold turned meetings into decisions, not endless opinions.
Results showed a clean pattern: A1 lifted CTR; A4 lifted trust. That
learning justified a combined variant: story on top, proof beneath. I
finally felt I was doing experimentation rather than decoration, and the
method is portable to future projects.

## **Diary Entry 4 — Transparency & ethics triggered a presentation pivot** **What happened**

## Survey respondents asked, “Where do these numbers come from?” and “What does ‘beneficiaries’ mean?” Our data period and definitions were hidden in a small footnote. Some photos and quotes also raised consent questions. We were credible, but not obviously so.

**What I learned**

We executed a presentation pivot rather than a proposition pivot. I
moved Data period + definition above the fold, added a partners line
(Midlands Diabetes Impact Group, Insulin for Life Australia, SolidaMed
Zimbabwe), and standardized footnotes. We formalized guardian consent
for minors’ images/quotes and allowed pseudonyms. This mapped to
Effectuation: we strengthened our crazy quilt (alliances as verifiable
anchors) and practiced lemonade—turning wording mistakes into precision
language and consent-first workflows.

**Why it matters**

I finally understood that transparency is a product feature, not a
disclaimer. By surfacing definitions and partners, we reduced cognitive
friction and pre-empted doubt. Trust scores improved, and questions
about sources dropped. The change also respected Chipo’s story: it
showed care for accuracy while keeping dignity at the center. For me,
this was a mindset shift from “tell a moving story” to “tell a moving,
checkable story,” which is a better fit for impact work.

## **Diary Entry 5 — Replacing low confidence with small systems** **What happened**

## I still hesitated to voice views, especially when unsure or when the topic felt “not my field.” Silence looked like agreement and slowed decisions. I also feared choosing the “wrong” path because I had little prior experience with nonprofit growth.

**What I learned**

I built small systems to replace hesitation. From Effectuation’s
affordable loss, I capped each test at 20–30 responses—enough to decide,
not to perfect. Before each call I prepared 1 recommendation + 1 risk +
1 alternative and committed to say them aloud. I kept one polite but
firm sentence ready: “I recommend keeping the data period visible above
the fold; if you prefer otherwise I’ll follow, but trust scores may
drop.” Finally, I asked for feedback on my English clarity, not on my
accent—something I can actually improve.

**Why it matters**

These habits made confidence a by-product of preparation, not
personality. They also mesh with Lean Startup: make a small bet,
measure, decide, move. As a team, we converged on the combined
variant—A1 for CTR + A4 for trust—and shipped a cleaner survey.
Personally, I learned to treat structure as scaffolding: when I cannot
rely on experience or perfect English, I can rely on systems that make
my work legible and my voice heard.
