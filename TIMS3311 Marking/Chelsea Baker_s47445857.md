## **Part 1: Critical Reflection Essay** 

Working with Aloe Vita through this TIMS3311 Work-Integrated Learning
(WIL) experience offered a rare opportunity to apply entrepreneurial
frameworks in a real-life, early-stage venture. Our team worked
alongside founder Leah Tassios, exploring target market validation,
potential marketing opportunities and possible go-to-market strategies
that can inform her future venture development. This essay reflects on
the lessons I have learned, the frameworks we applied and how this
experience has shaped my thinking about entrepreneurship and venture
creation.

### Prior Knowledge

Before this WIL experience, my prior knowledge of entrepreneurship was
mostly theoretical, having learnt entrepreneurial concepts and
frameworks throughout my degree. I had studied models such as the
business model canvas and the lean start-up approach in prior
coursework, but had not applied them in a real venture context. I felt
confident in synthesising academic theory and leading strategic
discussions, particularly around customer segmentation and brand
positioning due to my background in marketing. However, I quickly
realised that I had a tendency to want to seek clarity and resolution
straight away, searching for the “right” answer before testing
assumptions. This mindset proved limiting in the uncertainty of
early-stage venture development.

### Learning to Pivot

An early challenge that my team faced was designing our data collection
strategy. Initially, on September 8th, we had planned to use focus
groups to engage our potential target audience and test assumptions.
However, after discussions with Leah and our mentor, Jack, on September
15th, it became clear that pivoting to a hybrid approach, combining a
survey and one-on-one interviews, would yield deeper insights in the
first cycle of our assumption testing. This pivot reflected lean
startup’s emphasis on rapid learning through low-cost experimentation
(Ries, 2011). By integrating both quantitative and qualitative methods,
we were able to test assumptions more effectively and uncover
behavioural nuances that may have been missed with a single-method
approach.

Following this, a challenge arose in the development of our survey
design. Working closely with Leah, we had designed a comprehensive
survey that explored behavioural patterns, marketing conditions and
potential go-to-market strategies. However, after our meeting with Jack
on September 15, it was apparent that our current design was placing
excessive cognitive load on participants by exploring too many abstract
concepts without sufficient context. After this feedback, we realised
that complexity without clarity undermines engagement. This moment
challenged my instinct to seek immediate answers and strategic
resolution. By narrowing our focus to core behavioural indicators,
including wellness priorities and consumption habits, we were able to
align with the effectuation affordable loss principle by choosing to
test lean versions of our business model rather than over-investing in
premature solutions (Sarasvathy, 2001).

### MVP Formulation: Testing Brand Legitimacy

Prior to Leah’s HEXpo event on the 19th of September, we strategically
applied the lean startup methodology to create a landing page for Aloe
Vita as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In collaboration with Leah, the
landing page created included basic brand messaging, links to social
platforms and a call-to-action to stay in touch. This illustrates a lean
experiment to test brand legitimacy and early engagement. In our meeting
on October 16, we discussed layout, visual aspects and messaging
clarity. Designing the website helped to conceptualise early marketing
strategy and gather feedback before investing in full-scale development.
This reflected effectuation’s bird in hand principle, leveraging Leah’s
personal design skills and HEXpo visibility to deploy the MVP with
minimal cost.

However, one significant challenge remained throughout this experience:
a lack of a physical product to share and test with potential customers.
The drink is still in development with Monash Food and Innovation Hub
and is not yet ready for wider testing. This has made it difficult to
gain traction and test the product demand. Although not in our control,
the testing of the physical beverage would have been valuable to provide
feedback on taste and presentation and would have accelerated our
iteration cycles. This did, however, allow for the opportunity to spark
the idea of aloe vera-based drinks in the mind of our participants.

### Reframing the Problem

Another turning point came on 6 October, when we reviewed our interview
and survey findings. Leah had initially advocated for Generation Z to be
our target market, citing their trend sensitivity, skin health concerns
and digital engagement as key motivators, thus informing our
assumptions. However, as we analysed the data, it was clear that some of
the findings challenged our initial assumptions. Many Gen Z respondents
showed inconsistent wellness habits and price sensitivity, which didn’t
align with our more premium positioning assumptions. Survey responses
reinforced the importance of taste, price and health benefits as key
purchase drivers. Interviews revealed that many consumers viewed aloe
drinks as “old-fashioned” and “too distinct”. These insights prompted us
to look to reframe Aloe Vita not as a functional beverage, but as a
lifestyle brand representing inner beauty and self-care.

This was a significant moment in our project as it forced us to review
our initial assumptions and reframe the problem, which is encouraged in
design thinking through empathy and iteration (Brown, 2008). We also
applied lean startup methodology as we synthesised our insights and
revisited our initial value proposition canvas to make changes to
formulate new assumptions for the next cycle of testing (Ries, 2011).
Applying this theory along with the insights from our data collection
allowed our team to move from intuition to informed insight. Instead of
guessing who Aloe Vita was for, we were able to use real insights to see
where the demand was. As part of our next iteration cycle assumption
formulation on October 15, we looked to explore these insights further
by understanding what marketing concepts appealed to respondents and
also explore possible go-to-market options for the venture.

### Growth and Transformation 

Reflecting on this experience, working with Aloe Vita has shifted how I
view launching a startup and the strategies used to guide the process.
I've become more comfortable with uncertainty and the unstructured
nature of venture creation, learning that early-stage entrepreneurship
is about asking the right questions, not having the perfect idea.
Applying lean startup, design thinking, and effectuation in real time
moved me from theoretical analysis to evidence-based strategies for Aloe
Vita.

This experience has highlighted the importance of relationships and
networks, especially in the startup landscape and also doing it solo.
Building a network of people around you that you can go to for support,
guidance and advice is so important as it helps lead the venture
creation in the right direction and lessens the burden on the
entrepreneur doing it alone. This experience has been valuable to see
this in action and view how Leah utilises her network and connections to
help fill in the gaps of her expertise in the early stages of venture
development, in line with effectuation’s crazy quilt principle.

### Career Impact and Future Thinking

This WIL experience has helped make me more confident in applying
iterative methods, challenging assumptions and designing lean
experiments. These capabilities are directly transferrable to roles in
strategy and innovation and in my career in marketing. I am particularly
interested in applying these skills to understand how behavioural
insights and lean experimentation can drive meaningful change in my role
in the sporting field. The ability to test engagement strategies with
followers and iterate based on feedback and media engagement will help
to strengthen how I communicate effectively.

It has also made me reflect on how external perspectives can challenge
internal assumptions. Throughout the project, I saw how easy it is to
become attached to an idea or market segment that may not fit. This
experience has taught me to zoom out, test assumptions and remain open
to alternative strategies.

### Course Feedback and Recommendations 

What I valued most about this WIL experience was the opportunity to
apply theory in a real venture. The integration of theory created a
unique learning environment that mirrored the real-world complexities of
starting a business. It encouraged autonomy, critical thinking and
strategic experimentation, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

Based on my experience, I’d recommend three improvements that could be
implemented. First, having a more structured outline of key
deliverables. For our placement, our venture was in very early stages so
some of the key elements and MVP testing was not ready within our time
period. I think it would be really valuable to have clearer deliverable
items depending on the stage of our venture to help guide our insights
for our final report. Second, more opportunities for peer-to-peer
feedback. I found the opportunities that we got to receive feedback and
talk about our ideas with our peers to be really valuable in expanding
the way we thought about our venture’s problem. Third, increase exposure
to external mentors. Although we get paired up with a new startup and
can utilise their networks, getting to hear and learn from other
entrepreneurs would be valuable not only for those paired with startups,
but also for those who are starting a venture from scratch.

## **Part 2: Reflective Diary Entries**

### Reflective Diary Entry 1 – Monday 8 September 2025 

Today, our project team had a Zoom call with our founder, Leah, to align
our strategic priorities for Aloe Vita in preparation for her upcoming
appearance at HEXpo in Melbourne. Our discussions centred on target
market assumptions, distribution channels and the refinement of our
preliminary survey design. A key point of our discussion was Leah’s
current positioning strategy towards Generation Z as the primary target
market, citing their high engagement with social media and
responsiveness to emerging trends as key motivators.

I have reservations about the limited discretionary spending of this
target market and question whether university students would look to
prioritise Aloe vera functional beverages. Instead, I view and predict
that the product may resonate more strongly with 30 – 45-year-olds who
typically have more established routines and disposable income to
support wellness-oriented purposes. This difference in opinions
highlighted a critical learning that target market assumptions must be
challenged and tested to reflect consumer preferences.

Following this meeting, my team revisited our Business Model Canvas
(BMC) and developed a value proposition canvas to better articulate
initial customer needs and refine our assumptions. Additionally, we
transitioned our data collection strategy. We had initially intended to
use focus groups; however, we decided to pivot to use a survey. This was
an intentional application of the lean startup methodology as it is
designed to accelerate iteration between cycles and improve the
precision of our assumption testing. This shift reinforced another key
insight: agile, evidence-based approaches allow start-ups to reduce risk
and reach the intended target-audience.

These steps were important to address as misaligned targeting can
undermine product adoption and waste resources, especially as Aloe Vita
is in the early stages of development. By applying lean start-up
principles, we are better positioned to validate our direction and
ensure that Aloe Vita resonates with the right audience.

### Reflective Diary Entry 2 – Monday 15 September 2025

Today our team met with Jack to refine our survey and research
methodology ahead of the HEXpo event. This meeting helped to clarify our
next steps and highlighted limitations in our current survey design.
Specifically, our survey design was placing an excessive cognitive load
on participants by asking them to interpret abstract brand concepts and
engage with too many ideas at the same time. The survey was trying to
explore too many concepts, so we simplified the design to help us
understand if there is demand for Aloe Vita’s product among Generation
Z.

This refinement directly supports the lean start up principle of testing
assumptions quickly and cheaply, using targeted feedback to validate our
hypotheses from the value proposition canvas. By narrowing the scope, we
increase the likelihood of reliable data and actionable insights.

Building on our previous shift from focus groups to surveys, we also
plan to conduct interviews, allowing us to explore the contextual habits
and emotional drivers that quantitative data alone may overlook. This
hybrid approach reflects design thinking’s double diamond approach,
enabling my group to diverge into the problem space through ethnographic
inquiry and converge into the solution space with refined brand
concepts.

From an effectuation perspective, we are leveraging our existing
networks and industry events for convenient sampling. This allows us to
test early-stage hypotheses with minimal resource investment while still
working towards strategic goals of understanding consumer behaviours.
Ultimately, these findings will work together to give our team strong
insights into if there is a market need or demand for functional
beverages that benefit skin and will help to inform later stages of our
iterative process.

### Reflective Journal TIMS3311 Entry 3 – Tuesday 16 September 2025

Today, our team collaborated on building a draft website landing page
with Leah ahead of the HEXpo event. With limited resources, Leah had
reached out to a friend who was familiar with website mock-ups and
designs to help create a basic landing page. This was a clear example of
effectuation in action as she used available resources and networks to
move the venture forward with minimal cost or risk. This made me reflect
that early-stage entrepreneurship often relies on the founder being
resourceful rather than seeking perfection.

The website also serves as a minimum viable product (MVP). The page
includes basic initial branding, links to social platforms and a
call-to-action for survey participation. This MVP helps to test core
assumptions as it looks to explore if people will engage with Aloe
Vita’s brand and message enough to learn more or participate in future
stages of venture development. This lean experiment aligns with lean
startup principles, helping us validate interest before investing
further.

We also began developing customer persona outlines based on our initial
target market assumptions. This helped us to diverge into the problem
space, identifying the behavioural patterns, emotional drivers and
lifestyle preferences of our customer personas. It was a practical
application of design thinking’s double diamond model by moving from a
broad exploration to a focused definition., These personas will help
guide our next round of interviews and help refine our messaging and
product positioning.

Overall, today reinforced the value of testing early. Even with limited
resources, we are learning how to build momentum and make strategic
decisions grounded in empathy and evidence.

### Reflective Dairy Entry 4 – Monday October 6<sup>th</sup> 2025

Today we reviewed the results from our initial interviews and survey
results to uncover several insights that challenged our early
assumptions. In total, we collected 71 survey responses and conducted 15
interviews. It became clear that many of our initial assumption about
Aloe Vita appealing to Generation Z women would need revisiting.

We assumed that health benefits, especially skin and gut health, would
be primary drivers of interest for Generation Z women. While respondents
did express interest in skin nourishment and digestive health, the
findings revealed that taste, convenience and brand trust were more
influential in purchase decisions. There were concerns for aloe
vera-based drinks having too distinct of a taste, with some viewing it
as “old fashioned”, thus challenging our assumption that aloe vera
naturally relates to youth and wellness.

These findings have prompted our group to revisit our assumptions and
initial positioning strategies. Instead of framing it from a purely
functional health drink perspective, we are now exploring it from a
lifestyle brand that centres on inner beauty and self-care. This shift
is guided by design thinking, which encourages empathy and user-centred
problem framing.

As we prepare for our second round of interviews, we look to revisit our
value proposition canvas and create new assumptions to test. This marks
the beginning of our next lean startup cycle where we look to explore
flavour preferences, packaging appeal and go to market strategies.
Applying theory in this way has helped us move from purely intuition to
insight, thus ensuring our decisions are grounded in real consumer
behaviours.

### Reflective Dairy Entry 5 – October 15<sup>th</sup> 

After reviewing our results, we have started to formulate our second
round of interview questions to test new assumptions based on our
updated value proposition canvas. This next cycle is more focused
towards moving beyond broad validation and into a more targeted
exploration of flavour preferences, packaging appeal and go-to-market
strategies for Aloe Vita.

Based on our in-class discussions from Monday, we have recognised just
how early-stage this venture is. Without a physical product, we are
relying on mock-ups and concept testing to stimulate consumer reactions.
We are planning to test flavour profiles by exploring stated
preferences, gauging how consumers respond to functional ingredients,
especially those that can have a strong taste, with that being a key
concern from our findings.

This stage in our placement is also pushing us to think critically about
product-market fit. We have looked to apply design thinking to stay open
to the problem space by keeping the product concept fixed while
experimenting with different consumer groups. This approach encourages
us to isolate specific consumer desires and learn faster.

We are also asking ourselves: where does Aloe Vita fit in the market? Is
the drink more of a wellness lifestyle product or a functional beverage?
These questions will shape our iteration of branding concepts and how we
will look to position Aloe Vita in the market.

Overall, this iterative process is teaching me that early-stage venture
development is about staying curious and continuously looking to ask
more questions and test assumptions, in line with the lean startup
approach.
