**Overall WIL Experience**

*Personal lessons*

The most valuable part of Work Integrated Learning (WIL) within a
university degree is walking away with real-world, practical knowledge
that prepares students for their future careers. It brings me joy
knowing my experience reflected this value. Although I only spent just
under ten weeks pursuing my startup, I leave this major with new
insights that will be useful in my professional life.

I’ve learnt that a business startup does not need to be overcomplicated.
I once believed success required a “lightbulb moment.” Effectuation
principles taught me otherwise. Sometimes it starts with a simple
problem you face yourself or one common in a community you belong to.
Ideas are free-flowing and adaptable, not rigid or set in stone. This
understanding brought new meaning to the concept of design thinking. I
also realised that technical skills aren’t always necessary to start a
business, but knowing how to leverage available resources is essential.

While practical action carries more weight than theory, a solid
theoretical foundation can minimise wasted effort and reduce risk.
Working within the limits of a student budget, I applied lean startup
methodologies to create a minimum viable product (MVP) and gather
customer feedback. I found this process equally, if not more, valuable
than traditional data collection through interviews.

I pushed myself outside my comfort zone, particularly when reaching out
to my first potential supplier at AlgaePharm to explore a partnership.
Taking that initiative paid off as I gained a valuable contact and a
free batch of Queensland-grown microalgae for experimentation. This was
a major highlight, alongside developing a successful product after two
rounds of testing and even preferring it to my store-bought
alternatives.

Of course, not everything came easily. Finding interview participants
proved challenging, as was iterating on product fragrances to achieve a
desirable scent. Balancing startup development with other
responsibilities, such as work and study, was also demanding.

Overall, done differently, I probably wouldn’t have waited so long to
start experimenting with creating an MVP. I understood that it was a
real possibility for me to do so while also progressing through the
thick data market research stage. I also wouldn’t have let the
possibility of success intimidate me - I’d trust the process, the
feedback, and give it a proper crack much earlier on.

*Networks established*

The WIL experience opened doors to new connections with peers in my
cohort, some being familiar faces and others new. A standout
conversation was with my classmate Will, where we discussed
collaborating on this project. He suggested we each pursue our own ideas
during the course, then potentially join forces afterward if one showed
greater promise. It was interesting to see how he had used the double
diamond in this context.

I also established a valuable relationship with a real-world business
owner at AlgaePharm, my first official supplier. This connection could
prove invaluable if I continue exploring microalgae-based products in
the future.

**New knowledge, insights and practical skills**

*The Past*

My prior experience mainly came from entrepreneurship courses at UQ. In
*Growth Strategies*, I explored an AI-powered platform to improve
communication between tenants, property managers, and landlords,
conducting interviews with industry stakeholders and experimenting with
low-code tools such as Bubble.io.

In *Social Entrepreneurship*, my team tackled youth recidivism in
Queensland using systems thinking and the theory of change. Interviewing
former youth detainees gave me new perspectives and reinforced the value
of mapping complex social systems to identify leverage points for
innovation.

*Key learnings*

This WIL experience gave me the opportunity to be able to apply some of
the entrepreneurship theories I had previously learnt about in a
practical setting. Primary theories I explored were effectuation and
lean startup methodology.

Effectuation is a concept first coined by Sarasvathy in 2001, defined as
a form of entrepreneurial thinking to create opportunities based on the
set of available means and stakeholder interactions rather than planning
for and predicting a specific outcome (Sarasvathy, 2001). In the context
of my hair moisturizer, this was mostly seen in the form of the
‘Bird-in-hand’ principle, also defined by Sarasvathy as one of the 5
core principles of effectuation. It suggests that entrepreneurs start by
asking themselves who they are, what they know and whom they know. For
me, this meant recognising my own struggle with hair hydration and
identifying others with similar challenges. Drawing on previous exposure
to the use of microalgae for its nutritional benefits, I saw potential
to apply it in hair care.

Lean startup methodology was another entrepreneurial theory I found
myself applying in this WIL. As defined by Ries, lean startup empowers
business building through learning, experimentation and iteration (Ries,
2011). I was able access to most of the equipment required in creating a
minimum viable product (MVP) by utilizing everyday kitchen items,
helping me experiment with an AI-designed recipe. Furthermore,
consistent with lean startup theory, the use of cheap pump bottles and
batch creation in small doses allowed me to iterate efficiently through
different combinations of ingredients and fragrances, gaining feedback
through the process regarding feel, smell and look.

Outside of the application of entrepreneurship theories, I developed a
couple of key skills throughout this process. I learnt what thick data
meant early in the course and found myself seeing its value through the
customer interviews I conducted. Going out into the market and talking
to people for 30 mins about a relatively minor topic in hair care
surprised me with how much information I was able to unpack. Obscurely,
I found relation to this skill with my current job as an accounting
intern at a truck factory. I meet with people from different departments
to understand the landscape of part rejection and scrap. This allows me
to identify certain and gaps in current procedures and where there may
be opportunities for innovative solutions, tying it together with
monetary value.

The practise of iteration was a useful skill I started to develop which
helped me narrow down an ideal product. Constant customer interaction
through my interviews and my MVP gave me real-time market feedback on my
idea. This helped me gain constant temp checks for what was working
well, and what could be focussed on less. Being able to stay fluid
during any startup is a valuable trait. Should I attempt to continue
pursuing my hair moisturiser business or another startup, being able to
adapt to what is proven to work in the market through real-time feedback
and allowing the path to reveal itself along the way is a key skill.

*The Future*

TIMS3311 has reaffirmed my interest in entrepreneurship and shown me
that startups don’t have to be an all-or-nothing pursuit. A business can
begin as a small side hustle driven by curiosity. Hair care is something
I’m oddly passionate about, and creating a product I genuinely use daily
motivates me to share it with others.

I originally chose the entrepreneurship major because I aspired to run
my own business, but until now, I felt stuck in theory. Up to this
point, it felt as if I had almost been procrastinating on this goal.
This WIL experience left me with no more excuses not to act on that
passion. Rather than chasing a “home run” startup idea, I’ve learned the
value of starting small and building momentum through hands-on
experimentation.

**Course feedback**

What I valued most about this WIL program was the level of trust and
autonomy given to students. We were encouraged to take ownership of our
projects and learn by doing, which made the experience feel authentic.
The regular check-ins were also extremely useful for keeping me
accountable while still allowing flexibility. I particularly enjoyed how
success in the course largely depended on the amount of work put into
it. It felt as if the more work put in, the more I got out of it. This
felt like a true and honest representation of entrepreneurship.

With that being said, there are a few ways I believe the program could
be strengthened:

1.  **Make check-ins mandatory or linked to overall grade.** Setting a
    minimum number of check-ins (e.g., five across the semester) and
    tying them to a small grade incentive could ensure consistent
    engagement.

2.  **Support continuation beyond the course.** Being a WIL capstone
    project, it would be cool to include a concluding type of
    consultation / piece of advice to allow students to continue their
    pursuit in whichever option they ended up choosing. For example,
    within startup placements, providing the opportunity for 1-3
    students to receive some sort of employment with the firm
    post-graduation.

3.  **Partner with Ventures Validate.** Integrating the course with the
    Validate program would give students access to additional mentorship
    and even potential seed funding. One student in our cohort did this
    independently and found great success, so formalising that link
    could be a strong addition.

**Reflective Diary Entries**

<u>Wednesday 30 June, 2025:</u>

Two days since our first workshop with Professor Andrews. I am looking
forward to this course as it will allow me to finally stop
'procrastinating' and have a crack at launching a startup. I am probably
leaning more towards option 2, although I don't want to commit to
anything just yet as I will be hearing the iLab pitches next Monday and
want to see if any of those ideas resonate with me. I have had a couple
of conversations with a classmate, Will, where he was explaining to me
his thinking around pursuing an idea within the education space. It
seems to be a passion of his and it resonated with me a fair bit too.
We'll watch this space to see if anything blooms from it. For now, just
a couple of readings to get through to prep for next week.

 

<u>Wednesday 27 August:</u>

It's been a while since I've updated this journal but I'm back now with
a few updates. Better late than never. Since my last entry, I have
officially decided to pursue my own venture called Marinus, which aims
to explore the use of microalgae in hair care, specifically as a hair
moisturizing product. On Monday just gone, I presented my initial ideas
to my class and I believe it was received well, with a few students
asking some great questions. I have managed to gather around 6 potential
people who have softly confirmed to being interviewed about their
post-shower hair care routine. This will be super beneficial for
understanding what some of the key pain points are, what they have found
which works and ultimately gaining thematic saturation to understand
where my product can become a potential alternative. The next steps from
here are to map out my Value Proposition which I will keep relatively
simple, using it to develop a framework of open-ended questions for my
interviews, then conducting interviews with my preliminary group of
willing participants. I will also aim to write here at least once per
week but more frequently if I feel the need to do so. Stay tuned.

  

<u>Monday 15 September:</u>

Two weeks since my first interview with Lara, I have now finished
interviewing 5 separate people, all who use some sort of hair product. I
have a few more people to interview in my pipeline so it will be good to
continue gathering insight. So far however, I have noticed there is a
large emphasis on hydration, which seems to be at the core for
maintaining healthy, curly hair. There hasn't been a whole lot of buy in
regarding environmentally friendly substitutes, with almost everyone not
valuing the importance of environmental impact on their choice of hair
product. Results are the main concern. For some, results means avoiding
hair drying out after using bleach, something often overlooked when
people decide to change their hair colour. For others, it's about having
as natural a feel as possible where the hair doesn't feel too oily or
look too shiny but still provides them with the hydration necessary for
lasting the day. Apart from interviews, I have managed to use AI to come
up with a basic recipe for designing an MVP for my hair moisturiser
product. I have also found a place called Australian Wholesale Oils, a
store that sells all sorts of natural and organic oils made in
Australia. In the coming days, I will attempt to get in contact with the
owners at AlgaePharm to attempt to purchase some of their microalgae for
product testing.

 

<u>Thursday 2 October</u>

As I'm writing this entry in my journal, we are currently in our
mid-semester break, a good opportunity to recalibrate and get my ducks
in a row. I have completed 10 interviews comprising mostly of men who
struggle with dry hair and use some sort of product or implement a
specific routine to cope. My most recent interview was with a close
friend of mine, Connor, who embodied a lot of the values most of my
other interviewees spoke of. His routine predominately focussed on
preserving a natural look when using products and maintaining his hair
throughout the week. His main focus remained on hydration and preventing
moisture from leaving the hair throughout the day. There was an emphasis
on light, less oily products that provided for a natural feel over heavy
creams and oil-dense solutions that could potentially irritate
acne-prone skin. While the idea of environmental preservation was
well-regarded, it is not something he actively researches or uses to
determine what products he buys. He shares similar views when it comes
to ingredient composition. He did however place higher value on
Australian-made or locally sourced products, explaining that he
associates these with trust, quality and regional familiarity. I found
that his responses were pretty on par with some of the themes I was
establishing from my other interviewees, particularly on the 'locally
sourced' front. Apart from interviews, I was able to get through to
AlgaePharm and retrieve the contact number of the owner, Steve, who upon
hearing my project was very fascinated and decided to send me a batch of
his Nannochloropsis Occulata microalgae. Additionally, I placed an order
with Australia Wholesale Oils (AWO) for the other ingredients required
in creating my hair moisturizer. Hopefully by next weekend, both orders
will arrive and I can start experimenting the recipe designed by
Chat-GPT.

<u>Sunday 12 October</u>

This weekend, I finally start product experimentation. I was very
pleased to come home and find that the microalgae batch Steve had said
he was going to send me had arrived. I also managed to pick up a parcel
from the post-office which contained all the other key ingredients from
AWO. After purchasing a couple of extra items, I came home and began the
testing. I used the recipe as provided by Chat-GPT, along with a
homemade water bath, two glass cups, a thermometer and scales to produce
my first batch of Marinus Hair Moisturiser. This batch however was not
exactly how I had expected it to turn out. It almost looked like a
homemade pesto and smelt very potent. After reviewing my recipe doing
some online reading, I learnt that powdered microalgae is better
pre-dispersed in the water phase, as opposed to oil form microalgae with
sits better in the oil phase. I changed this, and yielded surprisingly
good results. The consistency was smooth and light, it form a thin film
full of moisture and did not smell as potent. After letting it cool down
for a while, I added the Vitamin E and essential oils for fragrance
(Eucalyptus and Lavender). After letting it cool overnight, I notice the
scent of the essential oils had blended well with the natural algae
smell, so much so that it was almost unnoticeable. I am going to look
into some natural preservative options and different fragrances while I
gain feedback on this batch to get closer to a market ready product.
