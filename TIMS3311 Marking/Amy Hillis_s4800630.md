## Part 1: Reflective Diary Entries 

## Diary Entry 1 

## Date 26/08/2025 

Today we submitted our project pitch to Siobhan Coster the CEO of
Eclipse ingredients. This allowed me to present our plans for the
project and rough timeline we hoped to complete essential tasks. I had
started creating value proposition canvases which generated
breakthroughs. Such as age not being an important factor in lactoferrins
value as a cosmetic ingredient. Repetition was rampant throughout these
initial canvases, which we assume will be further validated upon
completion of interviews. This inspired us to generate some ideas using
the crazy 8’s activity to quickly ideate products based on our value
proposition canvases. During our next meeting with Siobhan, we presented
our initial product ideas from crazy 8’s. We made the unfortunate
mistake of ideating products that were short lasting. She advised us
that lactoferrin only works in long lasting products that sit on the
skin without being washed off. This meant our ideas were cut in half.
This however will be beneficial in our MVP creation and influence
interview questions. We also asked her opinion on the repetition within
lactoferrins value and if this was something she had encountered in her
own research. She clarified to us that she also had identified a lot of
repetition within lactoferrins value. A critical question Siobhan wanted
answered is, what is the specific benefit that should be marketed to
generate the most sales? This enabled us to pause research on age
demographics and refine our interviews to focus on lactoferrins
benefits. All of this was important in identifying our strength as a
group in pivoting from our initial assumptions. An important lesson we
learnt this week is that in customer development we must be adaptable as
consumer needs and demands are constantly changing.

## Diary Entry 2

## 1/9/2025

Today we took a dive into lean start-up methods by submitting our
interview questions to Siobhan. She gave us some small comments and
advice on areas such wanted covered such as, people thoughts on
sustainability, or vegan ingredients. We elected for a divide and
conquer strategy with each of us completing 10 interviews with our joint
questions. We felt this enabled us to reach a more diverse audience with
our combined networks. Once we received the all clear from Siobhan, we
began our customer interviews. I was lucky enough to attend high school
with an up and coming skincare influencer with connections throughout
the skincare industry. She provided insights into skincare on a
personal, influencer, and business level. During the interview I asked
if she researched brands were effective before representing them. Here
she provided valuable information into the background of influencing and
product representation. She stated that she refused to represent brands
that had no proven results as she has a reputation to uphold. As I had
completed other interviews beforehand a clear marketing insight was them
wanting real people with real skin issues to market products
effectiveness. This went against our initial hypothesis that most people
follow influencer marketing strategies. Yet exposed a niche desire of
influencers with real skincare concerns marketing new proven products
and ingredients. Interviews also confirmed moisturiser as a key MVP as
well as other products such as sunscreen, cleanser, and facial serums.
This proved as an important step in our project as it enabled us to test
our initial hypotheses and pivot our project accordingly. We found our
strength was in hypothesising MVP’s as we found interviews confirmed our
initial assumptions. This week’s lesson for us was in order to conduct a
valuable interview you must improvise your questions along the way.

## Diary Entry 3

## 8/9/2025

This week we finalised our interview summaries and sent these through to
Siobhan. Continuing with lean start-up activities, we combined our
initial assumptions and interview summaries. To identify “How We Might”
make lactoferrin appealing to target customers. We found in our
interviews moisturiser was a key skincare product for almost all
interview participants. However, a lot of them were extremely loyal to
their chosen brand, but not their formulas. As such we want back to some
participants and asked them how they would feel if their favourite
brands incorporated lactoferrin into their existing products. During the
interviews we asked them what their go to brands were and identified
that consumers are researching smaller targeted skincare brands. This
inspired us to create MVP’s the focused less on brand and more on
lactoferrins benefits. During interviews we identified that proven
results could destroy brand loyalty. Consumers want to know something
works before they commit to using it. As such we are currently in the
ideation stage for the MVP’s however have decided we will both create 2
MVP’s and select the ones we believe meet consumer desires. I have
elected to create a moisturiser and a sunscreen as these were mentioned
the most throughout my interviews. As I have been creating the MVP’s I
have identified my strength in ideation. I found it difficult to narrow
down a set design for the MVP and found my weakness to be application.
My skills with technology inhibited my ability to create a MVP that
matched my original ideas. However, I am happy with how my initial
designs are turning out before they are submitted to Siobhan for
feedback. A key lesson from this week was not getting too stuck on our
main MVP and ensuring we stayed creative in our ideation.

## Diary Entry 4

## 29/9/2025

Today we finalised our MVP designs and decided to narrow down our top 3
products and product designs. After discussion with Siobhan, we found we
made the mistake of focusing on too many variables. We needed to narrow
down what our MVPS were targeting. To make this easier and avoid
changing all our MVP’s we decided to separate our moisturiser designs.
We know it’s a popular product but if given a choice between acne
management or hydration what is the most popular option. What will
people choose? Therefore, we created two Moisturizer MVP’s to be
compared and contrasted against our facial serum and sunscreen. During
the meeting this week Siobhan provided the valuable insight that
sunscreen would prove to be a difficult product due to the rigorous
regulations. However, we felt this was necessary to include within our
research due to its popularity in interviews. This generates insight for
Siobhan if she chooses to grow her product options within the cosmetics
industry. We are struggling to decide the best way to test our 4 MVP’s
and gain the most insight. Amairaa and I have diverse networks however
we have found them to be quite small. As such we know we need to use
public forums and believe online to be the best option. Our main idea is
to create a survey that compares the MVP’s and allows for insight to be
generated. We hope a clear MVP is identified and there is some interest
in other products. By using a survey, we would be able to easily obtain
a large number of responses. The survey would need to concisely explain
the benefits of lactoferrin and contain enough questions to get viable
data.

## Diary Entry 5

## 10/10/2025

As we near the final weeks we are now narrowing down our final MVP which
we will run multiple experiments on. We have finalised our survey and
received confirmation from Siobhan to go ahead with it. She provided a
small paragraph recommendation on what we should say about lactoferrin
which will enable informed responses. The survey mostly consists of
questions about the moisturisers and what aspects interest consumers the
most. Near the end of the survey, we introduce the other MVP’s and if
they would be interested in these products purely on the basis of them
containing lactoferrin. We have kept the survey short and simple yet
open enough to get a real sense of the consumer mindset. Shortly after
the survey was sent out via Instagram, I had a valuable conversation
with my uncle Jim. He is a project manager and provided feedback on the
survey and what I could change to make our results stronger.
Articulation is not one of my strong suits, his advice allowed me to
edit the questions ensuring better responses. My strengths are in
actions not words. His input will enable us to gain real insight into
what customers want and need the most. We initially made the mistake of
having too many MVP’s which confused responders in the tester survey.
It’s difficult to balance simplicity while also providing in depth data
for Siobhan. A key lesson we have learnt this week is presentation is
key to deriving valuable information from consumers. We are relying upon
consumers’ willingness to have a say on their skincare products. This
will hopefully allow Siobhan to sell lactoferrin to cosmetic companies
and have the knowledge that consumers are ready and waiting.

## Part 2: Critical Reflection 

A work in learning course is unlike any I have studied previously. You
are thrown into real world business situations after spending years
completing theory. This drastic change opens up opportunities to learn
about oneself and ones capabilities. I was never one to be creative, I
am a very analytical person. Completing this unit, I had the realisation
that in order to be truly analytical, one must also be creative. They
are not two separate qualities but rather a combination of one another.
I have also found overtime that I have the ability to communicate
effectively with everyone I discussed the project with. I pushed myself
to utilise connections that I wouldn’t normally approach in an effort to
gather reliable information. These qualities benefitted our group
particularly during the MVP design and ideation phase. I was able to
utilise programs such as Canva to create simple yet informative MVP’s.
These were quick and easy to design and create and has received positive
reactions within our consumer survey.

I like to think I have good time management skills however, a difficulty
within this project has been managing the workload. To combat this
challenge Amairaa and I decided upon a divide and conquer strategy. We
have found allowing autonomy combined with trust and supporting each
other’s capabilities to be an effective strategy. This has allowed us to
combine our ideas to create a shared yet diverse perspective on the
customer problem space. We have also found honesty to be a challenge;
consumers seem afraid to hurt my feelings. For most interviews I found
explaining that honest answers were necessary and they would not hurt my
feelings. While a simplistic solution it was rather effective in gaining
sometimes brutal perspectives. In hindsight with our knowledge now we
would have started our activities sooner and completed them more
quickly. We would not waste our time developing various MVP’s that don’t
meet Siobhan’s requirements. Hindsight is a wonderful thing; therefore,
we intend to carry these lessons and realisations into the final weeks
of our project.

Throughout this project I have utilised existing networks to expand my
connections allowing for more diverse data to be collected. On an
individual level I have reached out to family, friends, co-workers and
acquaintances. One in particular is connected to a variety of skincare
brands within Australia as they are a model and influencer. This
connection has enabled me to begin contacting businesses to secure
stakeholder commitments. Or at minimum information into their processes
for incorporating new innovative ingredients. This opened opportunity
for a network ecosystem of the company Lust Minerals. A clear value
identified has been lactoferrins versatility. This has at times proven
difficult to manage and taken time to identify a key selling point.
Consumer insights have highlighted potential value in lactoferrins
versatility by combining products into one further simplifying their
skincare routines. While completing design thinking activities we were
able to ideate a variety of products that could appeal to consumers. We
found value in simple products created by niche brands. Consumers are
discovering smaller brands and developing high levels of brand loyalty.
This is a smaller market Eclipse ingredients could enter and potentially
dominate.

Before starting this course all of my knowledge was theoretical with all
practical elements being contained within the controlled university
environment. This ensured my skill levels were adapted to respondents of
a particular age group. However, this project has required us to expand
from our university bubble and manage real world expectations. I entered
this course a beginner with little to no real world experience in such
projects. Overtime however, I have refined my existing skills and gained
insight into how methods of design thinking, lean start up, and
effectuation are all interconnected.

Throughout this project I have developed and refined my critical
thinking skills. This is due to the adaptability required of us in this
project. While a product may be popular with consumers it may involve
too many regulations or lack of effectiveness that we need to pivot. In
the beginning of the project design thinking concepts allowed for us to
think outside the box. Within our interviews a multitude of problems
were identified. Therefore, we needed to synthesise these problems into
one solution. Using design thinking allowed us to not get lost in the
web of problems and focus on the more prevalent issues. This process is
more efficient and effective than traditional methods (Luchs et al.,
2015). While all methodologies previously mentioned are critical to the
project’s success, I personally have found lean start-up techniques to
be the most valuable. Long term business planning is rejected; ideation
and experimentation is forefront. This better connects to the
entrepreneurial journey than traditional methodologies (Mansoori, 2017).
Experimenting with rapid ideation has enabled us to quickly and
effectively test multiple ideas. This allows us to easily pivot and
obtain an adaptable entrepreneurial mindset.

These methodologies stood out to me as they provided personal and
professional development. Lean startup techniques allowed me to be fluid
with my ideas and not stick to my usual rigid practices. To effectively
apply lean start-up methods, I needed to be adaptable and confident in
my ideas, while also being able to take on criticism. Applying lean
start-up has allowed me to explore ecosystems and networks of consumers
who provide the most informative insights into customer problems. They
have an urge to solve these problems and are willing to pay for an
effective solution (Mansoori, 2017). Design thinking provoked me to
combine my analytical skills and creativity to synthesise the customer
problem into a single solution. We were able to systematically and
collaboratively creative effective solutions to test and experiment with
(Luchs et al., 2015).

Areas in which we utilised entrepreneurial methodologies were most
influential during our Minimum viable product design and
experimentation. We needed to think creatively and strategically to
design a solution that actually addressed the core of the customer
problem. In this case the customer problem is not finding reliable
skincare that provides results. Therefore, we have attempted to create a
versatile yet reliable MVP’s. Lean start up techniques influenced our
interview process as we had no strict plan on how to conduct them. As
such we decided to split the interviews between us so we could reach a
more diverse network. As we learnt more in our interviews, we adapted
our interview questions to build off previous information given. This
allowed us to gain more effective and influential insights from
potential consumers. Enabling us to have a clear picture of the customer
problem. We have begun implementing effectuation activities in the final
weeks of the project. Siobhan would like us to approach businesses and
as such we are implementing the effectual ask and get specific criteria.
This will allow us to gain insights into the processes businesses have
when integrating new innovative ingredients.

Within my current career I deal with patient problems on a daily basis.
There is always some new problem, and a creative solution needs to be
formulated on the spot. Developing skills and techniques with design
thinking methodologies like crazy 8’s has allowed me to come up with
innovative solutions for customer problems. Lean start-up techniques
such as problem interviews allowed me to create solutions that are
easily testable. This has improved my overall adaptability within my
current and future workplaces. Effectuation practices have improved my
overall confidence and communication capabilities. Utilising the
effectual ask proved difficult yet useful. Asking people questions that
may make them uncomfortable is a part of my current career. Having the
ability to navigate difficult conversations while gathering insight to
create or market solutions will be highly effective in future. I leave
this course having learned the practical applications of the years of
theory. All the strings we have been collecting throughout this degree
have been tied into a bow that we are able to carry with us throughout
our current and future careers.
