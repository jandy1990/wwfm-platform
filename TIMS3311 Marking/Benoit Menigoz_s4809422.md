# Overall WIL Experience 

My WIL experience revolved around Anchorpoint Boat Buyers, a personal
startup I developed throughout the semester. Going into the program, my
main expectations were to connect with like-minded entrepreneurs,
receive feedback from mentors, and find practical ways to strengthen the
business model. I also wanted to refine my own professional discipline —
testing ideas, running experiments, and managing real campaigns rather
than purely theoretical exercises.

The most rewarding part of this experience was achieving tangible
business traction. I successfully designed, launched, and optimised
Google Ads and Meta campaigns, learning how to identify what genuinely
drives conversions and how data can guide decision-making. Through trial
and error, I came to appreciate the principle of “strong predictions,
lightly held” — the idea that confidence in one’s hypothesis must always
be balanced by flexibility to adapt when new evidence emerges. This
mindset has shaped the way I now approach not only marketing but
entrepreneurship as a whole.

At the same time, the process brought meaningful challenges. Balancing
the workload between my degree, the startup, and daily life required
constant time discipline. I also struggled initially with delegation and
learning to trust others with aspects of the business. Over time, I
realised that true progress comes from building processes and letting
others contribute, even if it means things are not done exactly my way.
Establishing daily and weekly goal systems became an important habit,
helping me stay focused and structured while still remaining adaptable.

Looking back, I wouldn’t fundamentally change my approach — the
intensity of the experience was what accelerated my learning. However, I
would place more deliberate emphasis on reflection and feedback earlier
in the journey to extract insights faster and manage my time more
sustainably.

## Networks 

Throughout the WIL experience, one of the most valuable outcomes was the
network I built among other solo founders in the cohort. We created
several informal group chats that quickly became safe spaces for sharing
progress, frustrations, and small wins. Unlike traditional group
projects, these connections were built on mutual understanding —
everyone was navigating the uncertainty of building something from
scratch, often alone. That shared experience created a strong sense of
empathy and community that I believe will extend beyond the course
itself.

Engaging with other founders also offered an exchange of both practical
advice and emotional support. I received helpful insights about
balancing growth with sustainability and testing ideas efficiently, but
I also found value in sharing my own lessons from Anchorpoint’s journey
— especially around marketing experimentation and resilience through
setbacks. This reciprocal exchange made the ecosystem feel collaborative
rather than competitive. It reminded me that entrepreneurship thrives on
openness, humility, and collective learning rather than isolation, and
it gave me a small but enduring community of peers I can turn to for
both feedback and motivation in the future.

# Knowledge, Insights and Practical Skills

## Prior Knowledge and Experience 

Before beginning the WIL experience, I already had a foundation in
entrepreneurship through previous ventures and university programs. I
had participated in UQ Ventures Singapore and UQIES Sydney, where I was
exposed to startup ecosystems and early-stage innovation practices. I
had also worked on small ventures such as *The Gingerbread Pan* and,
more importantly, developed extensive sales experience through reselling
boats — an activity that taught me how to identify market value and
negotiate effectively. However, while I was confident in communication
and business development, I recognised clear gaps in digital and
e-commerce capabilities, particularly around building websites, running
ad campaigns, and optimising performance. Strengthening these areas
became a major motivation and learning goal going into the WIL
experience.

## Conceptual Learning 

One of the most influential frameworks I applied throughout the WIL
experience was the Lean Startup Methodology (Ries, 2011). The central
idea of *“fail fast, fail hard, fail cheap”* became deeply embedded in
how I operated AnchorPoint. I learned that failure, when approached
systematically, is a critical feedback mechanism rather than a setback.
This philosophy shaped the way I approached almost every aspect of the
business — from building landing pages and testing Google and Meta ad
campaigns to refining the service model itself. Each small experiment
offered real-time feedback that guided data-driven decisions, allowing
me to quickly pivot or optimise without significant financial loss.

Through this process, I also gained a deeper appreciation for customer
validation and the iterative nature of innovation (Blank, 2013). By
analysing campaign data and engaging with customers directly, I realised
our target segment was broader than initially assumed. It extended
beyond middle-aged boating families in coastal Queensland to also
include *new boat buyers* who were reconsidering their options after
realising AnchorPoint could deliver a near-new experience at half the
price. Identifying this untapped customer segment highlighted the
importance of continuously refining assumptions and staying receptive to
market signals.

These learnings also reinforced the principle that the best investment I
can make is in my own capability to learn and adapt. The Lean Startup
mindset taught me to combine discipline with flexibility — to build,
measure, and learn in a constant feedback loop. This approach will
continue to shape how I develop future ventures and approach
decision-making in any professional environment that demands agility and
innovation.

## The Future Impact 

This WIL experience has strengthened my long-term motivation to keep
building ventures and to remain deeply involved in entrepreneurship.
Seeing other founders develop their own ideas alongside me was genuinely
inspiring and reaffirmed my belief that I want to spend my career
creating, testing, and scaling new businesses. One of the biggest
lessons I will carry forward is the importance of adaptability, being
flexible across every dimension, from marketing to team coordination and
product development. I see Anchorpoint continuing to grow, ideally
leading to a successful exit that allows me to channel what I’ve learned
into new ventures.

## Values and Improvements 

What I valued most about the WIL program was the opportunity to openly
share ideas and connect with other students who were also building their
own ventures. The environment encouraged genuine collaboration and idea
exchange, which helped me gain confidence in articulating my vision and
learning from others’ journeys. Beyond the practical skills, the
experience gave me clarity of direction — reinforcing that
entrepreneurship is not a single event but a continuous process of
learning, adapting, and experimenting. This sense of shared purpose
within the cohort made the experience both motivating and grounding.

For future iterations of the course, I have three main suggestions.  
First, I would love to see more individual-level collaboration
activities that allow founders to better understand each other’s
ventures and challenges on a deeper level.  
Second, incorporating short, informal presentation sessions throughout
the semester could help students refine their communication and pitching
skills.  
Finally, adding mini hackathons or rapid ideation exercises could make
key entrepreneurial concepts more experiential and practical. These
would not only build energy and creativity but also mirror the
fast-paced problem-solving required in real-world startup environments.

# Appendix A: Diaries

Entry 1 – Week 2:  
This week I focused on refining AnchorPoint’s positioning and
understanding how to communicate our value clearly. The feedback from
peers made me realise how important it is to simplify messaging. I also
started setting weekly goals to help track progress. The structure
really helps me stay accountable while balancing university work and the
business.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 2 – Week 4:  
I launched a new Google Ads campaign and learned that testing is far
more powerful than assumptions. Some ads I thought would perform well
completely underdelivered, while small tweaks made a big difference. It
reminded me to “fail fast, fail cheap” — the Lean Startup concept is
really playing out in practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 3 – Week 6:  
This week, conversations with other solo founders gave me valuable
reassurance. Everyone is going through similar highs and lows, and it’s
motivating to see how others push through uncertainty. I shared my
experiences running ads and learned a lot from others about building
confidence when facing setbacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 4 – Week 9:  
I spent time analysing customer data and realised our potential market
is broader than we first thought. We’re not just serving second-hand
boat buyers but also people who initially wanted new boats. This insight
came from real data, not assumptions, and it reinforced the importance
of listening to the customer above everything else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 5 – Week 11:  
As the semester ends, I’ve realised how much I’ve grown personally. My
ability to prioritise, stay disciplined, and adapt quickly has improved.
Seeing measurable results from AnchorPoint’s marketing work is
rewarding, but the real outcome is the mindset shift — I now see
entrepreneurship as a lifelong practice rather than a single project.
