Overall WIL Experience
For this course, I chose the Eclipse Ingredients Series A project. Previously, my
understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship remained rather idealistic,
focusing more on creativity, market opportunities, and product differentiation.
However, through in-depth discussions with three interviewees from the
investment, banking, and capital management fields, I gradually realised that
the actual value of innovation lies not in the uniqueness of a concept but in
whether a compliant, verifiable, and sustainable business system can be
formed behind it. Through the "hard asset" perspective of the first interviewee
(an investor), I discovered the difference in decision-making logic between
investors and entrepreneurs. The former focuses more on hard assets and
governance structure, while the latter tends to prefer telling stories about new
ideas. This made me realise that in the past, when I was studying theories, I
understood value creation more from a marketing perspective. In real-world
financing scenarios, innovation that gains the trust of investors requires support
from data, compliance, and execution. This shift in perspective led me to
consider how to integrate creative expression with structural design to form a
more appropriate closed loop. This gave me a new perspective on how to
evaluate the value of entrepreneurship, shifting from a creative approach to one
based on legitimacy, verifiable assets, and transparent governance. Through
my second interviewee’s (a bank financial product manager) perspective on risk
awareness, I gained insight into the importance of a systematic approach to
execution and verification, which further developed my understanding of the
closed execution loop (a continuous cycle of risk identification, budget design,
and data feedback). The event planning and closed budgeting in discussion
made me realise that financial products, constant verification and rapid
adjustment are also key to successful innovation. Through my third

                                        2
interviewee's (an investor), I gained insight into the role of data, compliance,
and transparency in building trust, and recognised the importance of structural
governance. In the past, I often focused on the market and product, neglecting
the sustainability of the underlying infrastructure. This made me realise that
innovation requires a balance between innovation-driven thinking and rational
logic.
During my WIL practice, I also faced challenges that not only tested my
communication skills and on-the-spot thinking, but also led to deeper reflection
and growth. First, the most significant challenges were information asymmetry
and professional barriers. The interviewees all had extensive experience in
investment, financing, and management. Their highly structured logic made it
challenging for me to pinpoint the core points during my initial questioning,
necessitating further follow-up. For instance, when interviewees discussed
capital structure optimisation and credit enhancement mechanisms, I had to
ask follow-up questions to grasp the underlying logic and measures. Afterwards,
I needed to re-examine the logic. This made me realise that theories are not
presented straightforwardly. Instead, further summarisation, induction, and
categorisation are required before further analysis and understanding.
Furthermore, I find that self-perception anxiety is a hidden psychological
challenge. When faced with interviewees' professional backgrounds, I worried
about my lack of knowledge and professionalism in my questions. However, it
was precisely this uncertainty that inspired me to develop a habit of proactively
seeking verification and continuous reflection when answering. When faced
with answers that did not fully capture my understanding, I chose to inquire
further, verify, and reflect, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of the
underlying logic. Cultivating this new habit has not only given me greater
confidence and composure when facing complex issues but also enabled me
to develop a problem-oriented learning approach. These challenges have
transformed my mindset from a knowledge absorber to an active explorer,
shifting from passive understanding to structured thinking and the ability to
                                        3
communicate across disciplines.


New Knowledge, Insights and Skills
This WIL project not only allowed me to understand the innovation process, but
also to systematically grasp the logic of entrepreneurial action. During the
interviews, I gradually transformed the entrepreneurial theories I had learned
about Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Effectuation. Design Thinking is a
human-centred innovation approach that emphasises understanding users and
their needs, defining problems, gaining a clearer understanding of their
motivations, and formulating them into clear and actionable problem statements
(Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011). Design thinking taught me the importance of
understanding users rather than simply presenting creative ideas. Early in the
project, I utilised the empathy phase of design thinking to develop interview
outlines, which enabled me to gain a deeper understanding of the actual
decision-making logic in various roles. As I gained an understanding of complex
assets and governance structures, I was able to define the focus of my research
questions more clearly. Based on Lean Startup theory, I conducted hypothesis
validation, customer discovery, and business model optimisation through rapid
hypothesis testing and iterative learning, achieving market validation with
minimal resources (HBR's 10 Must Reads. Vol. 2: On Strategy, 2020). This
taught me that verification and learning are more critical than perfect planning.
After the interview, I applied Lean Startup theory to reflect on and refine my
hypotheses. During the initial interviews, my primary focus was on the idea's
appeal. Still, the feedback I received was more inclined towards the feasibility
of execution.
Therefore, in the second round of interviews with financial product managers, I
promptly adjusted the direction of my questions, focusing more on data
verification and risk control. This helped me better understand and approach
real-world investment logic. Furthermore, the causal generation logic of
effectuation, where entrepreneurs start with existing resources and build
                                        4
opportunities through controllable actions and networks, is facilitated by the five
principles, which in turn enable resource-driven decision-making, uncertainty
management, and entrepreneurial action logic (Effectuation, 2025). It helped
me better understand the importance of resource-driven action and the search
for more opportunities amidst uncertainty. In the WIL project, I applied the crazy
quilt principle, one of the five principles, to construct a multi-layered cognitive
network, integrating the diverse professional perspectives of interviewees. By
combining    these   cross-disciplinary perspectives, I       gained   a   deeper
understanding of systematisation. This process also enhanced my cross-
disciplinary communication and systems thinking skills.


Future Impact
Participating in the WIL project and interviewing various investors and product
managers has given me a clearer perspective on my future career. I used to
prioritise creativity and analytical skills, but now I understand the core role of
data validation, compliance thinking, and a closed-loop execution system in
strategic consulting. The investors' emphasis on structure, data, and trust made
me realise that the consulting industry also relies on rational judgment and
verifiable insights. These new perspectives have heightened my awareness of
my future aspirations to become a strategic consultant, combining structured
thinking with an innovative vision. My career goal is to focus on strategic
consulting projects focused on technology transformation. In my future
consulting practice, I will combine the Lean Startup and Effectuation
frameworks, applying these thinking frameworks to the consulting process.
Furthermore, I will utilise cross-disciplinary communication skills within a team
environment to better align client goals with my internal consulting team and
achieve co-creation of value. Since I suffer from self-perception anxiety, I will
balance efficiency and quality in future consulting projects through reasonable
goal setting and periodic reviews. The WIL experience has inspired me to
develop my future career as not only a tool for business growth and industry
                                         5
development, but also a path to solving social problems.


Course Value & Suggestions
Throughout the WIL program, I enjoyed the learning model that integrated
theory with real-world industry practice. The company projects allowed me to
apply theories learned in class to a real business context, providing a proper
understanding of the entire process, from market research and solution
validation to team collaboration. Furthermore, the reflective journaling system
within the course was the most valuable component. Through continuous
recording and review, I learned to extract lessons from my actions, identify
patterns from my failures, and gradually develop the habit of self-awareness
and systematic reflection. Looking back on the entire WIL process, I would like
to make the following three suggestions for improvement. First, having career-
oriented support after the program ends will enable participants to understand
more clearly the effective connection between WIL learning and career path
planning. Second, establishing a continuous learning ecosystem within the WIL
program. This would enable students to transition into a long-term learning
network, comprising students, mentors, and industry partners, to explore further
and understand the impact of proposed solutions on the project's subsequent
development. Furthermore, through long-term learning networks, the course
structure will continuously incorporate student feedback and industry changes,
thereby constantly updating the instructional design to meet current market
needs. Thirdly, introducing previous case studies early in the course facilitates
a better understanding and application to practical decision-making.

                Five Reflective Diary Entries

Reflective Diary Entry 1 (The starting point in uncertainty: From "seeking
perfection" to "continuous verification")
When I first joined the Eclipse project, I believed that the key to a successful
fundraising strategy was finding the right investors. I spent countless hours
poring over reports and market analysis, trying to find a single, standard answer.
However, the more I researched, the more lost I became. Market data was
complex, and investment logic was diverse, to the point where no single source
could truly define VCs' needs and criteria. Later, I realised I needed to embrace
the core principles of the lean startup approach. It is about continuously
experimenting and validating hypotheses in uncertain environments. I also
applied a cycle of creation, testing, and learning to better understand investor
logic. For example, I hypothesised that investors focus on return cycles and
subsequently verified this hypothesis through interviews, thereby refining the
cycle to better align with reality. This experience helped me change my habit of
thinking before acting. I learned to act in ambiguity and systematically validate
it. This will enable me to apply a learning-by-action mindset and iterate rapidly
in future consulting roles and projects. This validate-by-action approach has
transformed the way I approach ambiguous problems.


Reflective Diary Entry 2 (From Theory to Strategy: The Power of Effective
Thinking)
When we began developing our investor map for Eclipse, I initially focused
solely on Series A biotech investors, attempting to pinpoint them precisely.
However, I quickly found myself stuck: the sample size was too narrow, and the
information was too vague. After communicating with the founders, I applied
effectuation theory to rethink my approach, shifting from understanding what I
knew to recognising what I lacked. I began using the bird-in-hand principle,

                                        8
working with existing resources—including lists provided by the founders,
existing partners, and publicly available databases. Incorporating the crazy quilt
principle, I established connections with investors in related fields and built a
map. Starting with existing resources, I categorised my search by region. Using
the investor lists provided by the founders, I explored additional potential
investors and compiled the findings in a table. At this point, I began to realise
that entrepreneurship is not a completely pre-planned map; it is a process of
exploration in the field. This shift not only freed me from fearing incomplete
information but also taught me to be more flexible and open to possibilities. This
enables me to continue utilising a resource-driven approach in future market
research and strategic planning.


Reflective Diary Entry 3 (Between Information and Strategy: From Data to
Insight)
When compiling my investor list, I initially viewed it as a mere data collection
exercise. However, after receiving feedback from the founders, such as "The
list is a great summary, but I would appreciate clearer guidance on next steps
and actions," I realised that data alone is meaningless and should be
transformed into a basis for decision-making. The key lies in translating this
data into actionable strategies. I redefined the task by applying the "define"
phase of design thinking, which helped me reflect on and understand the
underlying problem. I then conducted a cross-analysis across multiple
dimensions, including investor profiles, investment sectors, and fund stages, to
create a simple relationship diagram. I then incorporated systems thinking to
identify key leverage points. This realisation highlighted the importance of
information integration, which involves linking different data points to uncover
potential insights. I realised that analysis is not just about filtering information;
it is about creating a structured understanding. This will allow me to
continuously practice this "from table to strategy" mental leap in future product
or project management, guiding real data information toward sustainable action
                                          9
and facilitating the identification of leverage points within the system.


Reflective Diary Entry 4 (Use empathy to understand investors)
Before the formal interview, I felt anxious, worried that my questions were not
professional enough or that my understanding was not deep enough. However,
once I actually began, I realised that the interview was not a test of expertise,
but rather a process of listening and understanding. I drew inspiration from the
empathy stage of design thinking, using open-ended questions to understand
the interviewee's risk perception. One interviewee mentioned prioritising the
founding team's success. This made me realise that investors, like clients, need
understanding and trust. This interview helped me redefine the concept of
clients. Traditionally, clients are considered consumers; however, in the case of
Eclipse, investors can also be regarded as clients. After the interview, I used
empathy from design thinking to understand their risk perceptions and decision-
making logic. The rationality of the interviewee's narrative and the verifiability
of their assets made me realise the importance of systemic logic beyond data.
In this context, investors are also clients, purchasing not products but trust and
future growth potential. This shift in perspective allowed me to understand them
better during communication. In the future, I plan to maintain this empathy-
based approach when communicating with clients, partners, and teams.


Reflective Diary Entry 5 (Theory implementation: from learning to
integration)
As the project neared its end, we compiled all our theoretical and research
findings into a playbook. This moment made me realise that the theories and
models I learned in class can actually be implemented in real life. Our team
updated and reviewed the playbook weekly to ensure the theoretical support
and logical connections behind the strategy. This allowed me to move beyond
simply understanding theory to integrating thinking, communication, and action
in real-world business environments. Lean startup, effectuation, and systems
                                        10
thinking were rationalised within the framework, enabling the team to align their
logic in decision-making quickly. At this point, I experienced the transition from
knowing to doing, transforming theory from mere concepts into supporting
action and measures. Looking back on the project, I have shifted from initially
pursuing the most suitable investors to integrating thinking, communication,
and action in uncertain environments. This growth has given me a clearer vision
for my future. I aspire to be an innovative leader who can identify patterns in
complex systems and effectively apply theoretical insights to practical
applications.
