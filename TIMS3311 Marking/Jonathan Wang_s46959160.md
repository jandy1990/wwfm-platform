## Personal Lessons

Engaging in the Chatstat project through the TIMS3311 Work Integrated
Learning program was a defining period in my development as an aspiring
entrepreneur. The project’s focus on refining Chatstat’s model for
AI-based digital wellbeing platforms pushed me beyond theoretical
entrepreneurship and into real-world ambiguity, stakeholder complexity,
and iterative experimentation. Initially, I believed that
entrepreneurship was primarily focused on innovation, hustle, market
research, and theory. However, this experience taught me that empathy,
ethical design, and strategic patience are equally vital. Early in the
semester, my team and I entered with the assumption that Chatstat’s
school referral driven monitoring model would be feasible and welcomed.
However, after a series of Lean Startup style interviews, we quickly
encountered strong resistance. Schools feared liability, parents worried
about privacy, and students resisted surveillance. This tension became
the central insight that reshaped my understanding of value discovery
versus value imposition.

The highlight of this experience was finding reassurance of direction
after initial confusion regarding the product scope. This confusion
arose because the initial client pitch and briefing described a K–12
customer focus, yet the demonstrations we received of the existing MVP
were university and organisation oriented. The university version
analysed individual posts and provided deeper psychological insights,
which raised ethical and logistical concerns for application in schools.
These concerns prompted us to undertake a phase of deep problem
discovery that led to proposing a parent-licensed model, positioning
schools as facilitators rather than enforcers. This direction emerged
after dozens of stakeholder interviews revealed that parents wanted
reassurance but not intrusion, and schools wanted visibility without the
burden of data responsibility. Seeing that our conceptual shift was
already aligned with the Chatstat team’s long-term K-12 vision was
reassuring after weeks of uncertainty. While Chatstat plans to continue
the referral model, our parent-licensing concept will be tested
alongside it as part of ongoing Lean Startup experimentation and
interview validation.

From a personal standpoint, this experience reshaped my confidence and
adaptability. I learned that ambiguity is not a barrier but a natural
phase of innovation. I also discovered the importance of staying curious
and patient when insights evolve slower than expected. Earlier in the
project, I was uncomfortable presenting unpolished ideas, however, by
adopting a Lean Startup mindset, I learned to see imperfection as
progress. This helped me internalise that entrepreneurship is not about
achieving certainty but about learning faster than competitors.

## Networks Established

Throughout this project, I built valuable relationships both within my
team and with external stakeholders. My teammates provided diverse
perspectives that strengthened our analysis, while interactions with the
Chatstat team deepened my understanding of commercialising AI. Our
primary academic support came from Jack Andrews, our course coordinator,
who offered regular consultations and constructive guidance. Jack’s
feedback helped ensure our project remained on track, both
methodologically and academically. His emphasis on evidence based
validation and stakeholder empathy grounded our research and helped
translate classroom frameworks into applied decision making.

Beyond the university, conversations with school representatives,
parents, and students were pivotal. These interactions expanded my
professional network into the education and wellbeing sector while also
developing my interpersonal confidence. I learned to ask open ended,
non-leading questions and to interpret subtle emotional cues during
interviews being skills that improved both my data quality and
professional communication. Engaging with professionals and parents as
equals reinforced the importance of empathy, integrity, and trust in
entrepreneurial relationships.

## The Past

Prior to commencing this course, my understanding of entrepreneurship
was predominantly theoretical. I had studied models like the Business
Model Canvas and understood innovation frameworks in principle, but I
had not applied them to ambiguous, real world contexts. I tended to
think of entrepreneurship as primarily analytical and being solely a
discipline of research, planning, and execution. I lacked the
experiential understanding of how unpredictable stakeholder needs, time
pressures, and ethical considerations shape decision making.

When starting TIMS3311, my skillset was primarily in strategy and
presentation rather than experimentation or stakeholder facilitation.
The Chatstat project disrupted this static view as it was not only
analytical reasoning required but also creative resilience. The ability
to pivot rapidly, interpret feedback objectively, and communicate
uncertainty with confidence. Entering this project, I expected
structured workflows and predictable milestones. Instead, I encountered
an environment defined by evolving expectations, partial data, and
shifting objectives. This forced me to confront a core entrepreneurial
truth being that success depends less on knowing the answers and more on
asking the right questions.

## Key Learnings

The Lean Startup framework was central to my learning. Through
continuous hypothesis testing, we validated core assumptions
underpinning Chatstat’s K-12 strategy. Rather than framing interviews as
data collection, we treated them as live experiments and with each
conversation testing one hypothesis about stakeholder behaviour. For
example, our next steps are exploring whether parents would be more
willing to use Chatstat if they are given direct access through a
parent-licensed model or whether schools preferred a referral model that
minimised data responsibility. This iterative build, measure, learn
cycle shifted my mindset from problem solving to learning optimisation.
I realised that entrepreneurial progress is not measured by perfect
plans but by validated learning.

Design Thinking complemented this approach by grounding our work in
empathy and reframing. We discovered that words like “monitoring” or
“screening” triggered resistance, while reframing the product around
“digital wellbeing” and “supportive engagement” generated positive
responses. This taught me that language itself can be a design tool. The
empathy and define stages of Design Thinking also helped our team
recognise the emotional undercurrents influencing stakeholder trust, for
example, where parents were not rejecting Chatstat’s purpose but,
rejecting perceived loss of autonomy. Understanding this allowed us to
design communication and onboarding flows that prioritised reassurance
over control.

## The Future

This experience has had a profound impact on my professional trajectory.
It confirmed that my interests lie in the intersection of innovation,
ethics, and technology for social good. I am drawn to roles that require
balancing commercial viability with human centred design, such as
innovation consulting, product strategy, or social enterprise
development. The Chatstat project revealed that I am most engaged when
working at the convergence of research, empathy, and experimentation.

Personally, this experience taught me the value of reflection and
self-awareness. I believe I developed stronger emotional intelligence by
learning to facilitate collaboration rather than control it, and to
accept feedback as an opportunity rather than criticism. It also taught
me to approach problems from multiple lenses such as business
feasibility, ethical integrity, and human experience. The ability to
integrate these perspectives will, I believe, define my effectiveness in
future leadership and entrepreneurial roles.

## Course Feedback

What I valued most about TIMS3311 was its authenticity and structure.
The opportunity to work directly with an external client blurred the
boundary between academia and industry, creating genuine accountability.
The course successfully balanced theoretical grounding with practical
exposure, allowing me to apply Lean Startup and Design Thinking in a
live entrepreneurial setting. Having access to mentorship and feedback
from Jack Andrews ensured that we remained academically aligned while
experimenting creatively.

If I were to suggest improvements, I would recommend introducing an
earlier mentor engagement checkpoint to ensure project clarity from the
start, as we initially struggled with scope. Secondly, embedding a
structured mid semester reflection workshop could help students process
learning progressively rather than retrospectively. Finally, additional
attention on the theoretical frameworks supporting our process may be
beneficial as I personally would not have been confident in the
direction and process of discovery, we went through without reading the
required book, which I believe would not be engaged with amongst all
students.

In conclusion, this Work Integrated Learning experience transformed my
understanding of entrepreneurship from a theoretical construct into a
lived discipline. It taught me to embrace uncertainty, prioritise
empathy, and design with integrity. Most importantly, it reinforced that
innovation is not about imposing solutions but about creating value with
others. I believe the Chatstat project has made me a more grounded,
reflective, and resilient professional, one equipped to navigate the
ethical and human complexities of entrepreneurship in the real world.

## Entry 1: 11/8/25 – Chatstat Pitch and Team Formation

- Initial pitches from varying startups

- Team formation with Chris and Cooper, had previously worked in a team
  with both from previous courses

## Entry 2: 21/08/25 – Meeting with Chatstat, clarification of direction

- learned their tech stack is multi-vertical including parents, schools,
  HR/employers, investors, API integrations, corporate reputation
  monitoring and not just K-12.

- Chatstat is looking to have a viral growth model through schools
  distributing and parents converting

- Want to maintain public facing signals for detection

- Chatstat has too many potential markets

  - Shifted from broad approach in addressing universities and
    organisations due to Chatstat developing new MVP for parents and
    children

## 

## Entry 3: 15/09/25 – First Consult with Jack 

- Addressing feedback from initial pitch

## Entry 4: 16/09/25 – Lean Startup Principles

- Reading Eric Ries’ *The Lean Startup*

- Key Learning items:

  - 1\. Don’t build blindly - validate direction before building
    anything

    - Sought to find market segment clarity prior to pursuing
      development/committing to product

  - 2\. Hypotheses \> assumptions

    - Due to the MVP being developed already, taking a step back was
      necessary in moving forward

  - 3\. Co-creation with the customer early – rather than "pitching at
    them"

    - Initially avoided pitching the Chatstat model

    - Our customer is not only our buyer but a builder/co-creator

  - 4\. Thinking of distribution first rather than the product

    - “Who will do the selling for me?”

  - 5\. Build something that survives after you leave

    - Although time and commitment are somewhat limited in building a
      ‘self-sustaining’ contribution, by taking a step back from the
      initial MVP and requests from Chatstat, we as a group and provide
      core learnings regarding assumptions and customer feedback from
      hypothesis testing.

  - 6\. Validate the path before building the product

## Entry 5: 01/10/25 – Developing Proposed Model on gathered data from interviews

**Key findings, areas of discovery and interest.**

- 1\. Students do not want schools monitoring them directly

- 2\. Students are OK with protection if it doesn’t feel like
  surveillance

  - They want silent safety, not helicopter parenting.

- 3\. Cyberbullying is normalised and almost treated like weather

  - most don’t escalate until way too late

  - Early detection = valuable. But needs to be invisible / not
    embarrassing

- 4\. Parents think they are “aware” but aren’t actively monitoring
  their children

  - demand for alerts and not full surveillance

  - “tell me only when I actually need to step in.”

- 5\. schools want this, but cannot be the data-handlers

- 6\. parents are split, but the “proactive ones” are your true early
  adopters

  - Early adopters should be the target market

**Key takeaway from interviews:**

“We want protection before it becomes a crisis, but without invading
trust or privacy.”

I am proposing to the team at chatstat focuses on selling a license to
the schools for the parents to have access to.

**Key points and reasons for the changes being:**

\- Schools and Chatstat will be limited to public social media handles

\- Ethical concerns arising regarding requiring social handles or
liability in regards to the schools responsibility of handling cyber
bullying

\- Parents and students being willing to hand over information to
schools

**Key changes being:**

\- Parents and students will be provided full access to chatstat
services paid for through the school via licenses

\- Parents will have an AI brief overview, limited information to
healthy (green - no concern), Potential harm (yellow), and experiencing
harm and bullying (red)

\- Parents will be able to log in to chatstat through their children's
accounts (will allow for private account access as well as privacy to
the children)

\- Privacy to children produced through limiting device checks from
parents providing privacy with a simple AI overview/status of their
online behaviour

\- Parents will have the comfort of their childrens safety from a
distance without invading privacy

\- Schools will have fewer cases of cyber bullying (schools deal with
cyber bullying weeks to months after it is already too late)

\- Schools have limited liability as an optional service is provided to
all parents to use in hopes of reducing cyber bullying in the hands of
parental guidance

## Entry 6: 09/10/25 – Chatstat Project Update

- Today’s follow-up session with Chatstat was extremely clarifying. We
  proposed a parent-licensed access model (i.e. schools purchase
  licences but parents directly operate the platform) rather than
  Chatstat’s current referral model where schools simply distribute
  access codes via email or brochures and parents self-subscribe
  voluntarily.

- A key realisation was that Chatstat has always been parent-first in
  intention, but their current approach relies on parents independently
  choosing to upgrade, rather than schools fully “owning” the
  activation. In other words, we weren't suggesting a pivot as much as
  restructuring the delivery and trust-framing.

- What stood out is that the value proposition is almost identical,
  protection over surveillance, early signal detection, preserving
  privacy, but the difference now lies in how it’s packaged, perceived
  and triggered.

- Key Lesson:

  - The real friction isn’t what Chatstat does

    - It’s how it is introduced, who is seen as the ‘authority’, and who
      is seen as ‘initiating surveillance’

We now need to validate:

- Would parents pay for Chatstat, or do they only unlock it when it is
  school-endorsed and bundled?

- Does “provided to you by the school” create higher trust, legitimacy
  and uptake than “go download it yourself”?

- Do parents trust Chatstat enough to let it analyse their child’s
  public (or semi-private) digital footprint? What reassures them? What
  repels them?
