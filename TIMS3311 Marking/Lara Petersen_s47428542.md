1\. Overall WIL Experience

When it comes to assessment, projects or any type of university-related
work or any type of work in general, I tend to stick to what I know and
I’m passionate about, which is typically one of three things:
Fashion/beauty, Formula 1 or political/economic matters. I stick to what
I know and what I do well in, and thus can highlight my own experiences
or knowledge to contextualise issues relating to these industries and
switching from these to the health sector made me feel as though I was
floundering for purchase in an incredibly technical world. Taking part
in the WIL experience in an area where I have little to no connections,
networks or a high baseline of knowledge was difficult. It pulled me
completely out of my comfort zone and was something I had to actually
put the work in to understand and find ways in which to support the
venture in ways I haven’t had to before. Considering my lack of network
and connections in relevant industries, I invested more time into
research in ways to position and promote the venture to make its
introduction to the more stagnant tech involved in the health industry
more compatible and make its inclusion more streamlined and thus more
marketable. With only a few widespread systems in use by pharmacies, I
found it imperative to ensure that Pill flow can be used in conjunction
with these systems, as well as how they can be used by pharmacies. One
of the key learnings over the Entrepreneurship major and the Marketing
major is about positioning a brand, company or product to produce a
niche in the market to create consumer value – you can see the problem
and the solution but it’s about convincing consumers that this is the
best solution to the problem. One of the biggest challenges we found
throughout this experience was finding people to talk to about their
challenges regarding the problem itself. Considering the target market
was doctors and pharmacies, it was difficult to gain access to
considering bother their and my schedules. In hindsight, I would try and
connect with more pharmacy and medical students who have been involved
in placements already and can see the problems on hand and maybe have a
fresh view on issues experienced. On top of this, reaching out to
journalists who have written about the issues surrounding prescriptions
and e-scripts. Another challenge was the fact that the WIL placement was
very thorough already with their research and it sometimes felt we
hadn’t given enough value to them but were instead reinforcing their
ideas and research. The highlights so far of this experience have been
involving myself in an area I hadn’t previously researched or been
involved in and thus feeling I could really apply entrepreneurial theory
in a completely new way then previously.

2\. New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills

Prior to this experience, my knowledge and experience have always been
in relation to areas I have worked in or wish to work in the future,
specifically marketing in the fashion/beauty industry or the racing
industry. I already work in marketing for an agency in the hospitality
sector within Brisbane, as well as working for an Australian fashion
house as a client advisor - it’s a more comfortable space to be in
regards to both networks and personal interests.

Lean start-up method and Design thinking were the most valuable
throughout the WIL placement in their usage of confirming the viability
of the MVP and finding avenues for improvement throughout the placement.
Considering the MVP is already in development, we wanted to test the
product and confirm it’s viability for the market as well as find ways
of which we could create more value for the consumer. Lean start up was
especially applicable as we researched the industry more and through our
conversations with those related to the industry or involved we found
different avenues to make the product create more value for consumers
through an integration approach with current software. Keeping the soul
of the product the same whilst making it more usable. Utilising these
entrepreneurial concepts for my future career will be imperative,
considering the constantly changing nature of marketing trends and the
need to be constantly adaptable to changing consumer needs.

This experience definitely made me feel more adaptable in my skills
across different industries – beforehand, it was like I was stuck in
applying the skills and types of thinking I typically use for ventures
like Effectuation into areas I had the most resources to create viable
change for consumers, as I could easily understand the problem and
solution at hand. It made me feel more confident in utilising
entrepreneurial thinking in practice and in areas I did not already have
a baseline of experience and knowledge making it valuable as I can
create value in ways I might not have previously.

What I valued most about the course was being able to be involved in a
venture and pressure points involved, especially surrounding funding and
gaining consumers in a space that is monopolised by somewhat outdated
software. I suggest that for the following iterations of this course
that the venture is more equipped for taking on students and providing
more checkpoints throughout, especially if the venture already has an
incredible baseline for research and consumer research. It felt for the
first couple of weeks we were fumbling to find ways in which to create
value for the venture, and they didn’t have anything specific that they
wanted us to help/achieve throughout this placement. Another suggestion
is more options for ventures for students to choose from – most of the
options were quite niche and catered more to students in specialised
fields and can make students who already have specific areas they want
to work in feel as though they might not gain much out of the
experience. As most students are in the last year of study and thus may
be working already in industry on a full or part-time basis, the
workload associated with the course can be quite heavy, with the work
needed to be done for the placement on top of other courses being taken,
I think balancing this in a way to ensure students get the most out of
their placement whilst still being to continue their schedule is
imperative to overall experience. Ensuring skill set match up would be
crucial for this in ensuring that what students are already working in
or studying is what the venture is looking for from their involvement in
the placement as well.

# Reflective Diary Entries 

Week 5:

I had only just arrived back in Australia from studying in Italy on the
10<sup>th</sup> of august and was very sick in the two weeks following.
I was lucky that one of my friends was doing the course as well, so I
was able to stay somewhat up to date before I arrived. As we got
started, I felt really out of my depth as it was a completely new area
to research and wrap my head around, and with assessment 1 being my
first assignment back in the country, I was all over the place. Week 5
was also the first class I was able to attend for the semester. Our
first meeting with Pill flow occurred the previous Thursday and was more
of a check-in to meet us as well as to get an idea of where they were
at. It was primarily a catch-up up so not a lot of information was
gained through this for our first assessment. I wanted to feel on top
it, so I may have focused my research slightly off what the key points
of interest were for the WIL placement, which was somewhat evident in
the feedback from assessment 1. Moving on from here, we wanted to gain
more understanding of the industry we were working in and capture a
profile of our consumer or what the profile should be for the product,
whether it’s more B2B or B2C.

Week 6

We presented assessment 1 this week and had our second meeting with
pillflow. We had more of an agenda this meeting with specific areas we
want to address to focus our work for the following weeks. Our key
focuses were on their current beta programs, their successes and
failures, and if they were looking to expand outside of pharmacies etc
for now. Moving from here I wanted to utilise Lean start up methodology
as the product itself was in process in development, our best way to
generate value was to test the assumption and ensure the product met
consumer needs and created value. I also started looking into the market
to start building an external review of competition and the industry
itself to see how it fits in.

Week 8

We got sent the beta of the platform and were able to explore and play
around a bit with it, and got more of an idea of how the product itself
works, and it could be integrated with current systems. Within our
meeting, we also inquired about if any pharmacies were interested in
beta testing the product, and we found out Terry White is interested,
but at that point, they have yet to start testing the product. We were
having trouble getting in touch with other large pharmacies at this
point regarding interviews or play testing the product a this point as
well. I definitely prefer to be able to conduct interviews as you can
gain so much insight not only about how consumers view the product but
the problem itself and what they currently utilise to address the issue,
thus able to influence product design.

Week 10

I went for dinner with a doctor this week and was able to have a bit
more of a casual conversation about the product and the issues it’s
trying to solve. He found it interesting but within a hospital setting,
with a set process and software, it might be difficult to integrate and
use on a large scale. Whilst playing through the beta product, I found
you have to manually add in patients and their specific medication which
could be quite time-consuming for doctors to have to add and keep track
of. This inspired me to see if there was a way to collaborate with
competitors to have a more integrated program.

Week 11

Within our meeting this week I pitched the idea of collaborating with
Fred – one of the most used IT platforms in the health and
pharmaceutical space. It could enable a more seamless utilisation of
PillFlow and make the process a bit more automated then manual.
Alongside this, utilising the Government’s myhealthrecord to keep both
records up to date and enable another metric of checks and balances
within the program. A concern that had been brought up in our
conversations was security and confidentiality of the program with
patients, especially when that was a major concern with the
implementation of Myhealthrecords. As apart of our final hand off I want
to be able to pitch it in a more formal manner and be able to have the
data to support that the collaboration is worth investing in.
