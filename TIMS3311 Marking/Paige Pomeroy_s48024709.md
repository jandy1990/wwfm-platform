**Critical Reflection Essay \| *Overall WIL Experience***

***Personal Lessons***

Through my WIL experience with Eclipse, I learned a great deal about
myself and my capacity to adapt in a real-world entrepreneurial setting.
In particular, I discovered that I thrive when faced with ambiguity.
Being a part of a live venture required navigating situations where
there wasn’t always a clear direction or ‘right answer’, from designing
MVP concepts to interpreting customer insights. I learned I’m more
resourceful than I thought, finding creative ways to test ideas with
constraints of available resources, time and skills. I found it
fascinating how an interview could start in one direction and completely
shift based on the participant’s perspective, revealing unexpected
needs, behaviours, or motivations. However, a personal challenge for me
was balancing the desire to perfect ideas with the need to move quickly.
Early on, I noticed I could get caught up refining visuals or concepts
rather than testing them, which slowed progress. Overcoming this meant
embracing the ‘fail fast, learn quickly’ mindset.

***Network Establishment***

During my WIL experience, I was lucky to develop valuable networks both
within our student team and the start-up ecosystem. Working closely with
Siobhan Coster, the CEO, I gained first-hand insight into what it’s like
to manage a start-up venture, specifically within the bio-tech industry.
Siobhan not only guided our team through approaching interviews and MVP
development, but also supported us in the TIMS3310 course, where we
interviewed her as part of a leadership assignment using a wellbeing
polarity approach. What I found most interesting from Siobhan’s
experience is the challenges she faces with legal and regulatory aspects
of running a venture. As she has three phase’s she wants the venture to
step into, being lactoferrin in skincare, food and eventually baby
formula, each comes with its own unique set of barriers, which has given
me a real appreciation for the complexity of scaling a start-up across
multiple industries.

***New Knowledge, Insights and Skills***

***The Past***

Prior to commencing this course, I had limited practical experience in
entrepreneurship and innovation, having mainly engaged only with
theoretical concepts throughout my time at university. What particularly
sticks out to me is my time in the TIMS3302 course with Russel, where I
was part of a team who created the venture idea ‘Bite Back’, which aimed
to address food waste on campus by connecting students with local
vendors offering discounted surplus meals. Our team used a lean,
low-cost approach to develop a Facebook based MVP to test the
assumptions that students actively seek affordable, convenient food
options, and that vendors are willing to participate. This involved
surveying students, collaboration with vendors, and refining the model
based on feedback. Similarly, in TIMS1301, I worked on Geo Watch, a
smart soil management system for mine site rehabilitation. Over six
weeks, our team conducted extensive customer discovery interviews,
leveraged personal industry connections, and developed a functional
prototype app. These experiences allowed me to apply frameworks such as
lean start-up principles and MVP testing in future endeavours.

***Concepts and Theories***

Throughout the WIL experience working with the start-up venture Eclipse
Ingredients, the most significant entrepreneurial frameworks I engaged
with were lean start-up (60%), design thinking (30%), and effectuation
(10%), each shaping how myself and my team approached uncertainty and
innovation. The first building block of our entrepreneurial approach was
effectuation, as this provided us with the means of thinking about where
to start and what resources we have currently available to leverage at
the beginning of our journey. For Eclipse, this meant identifying what
was already accessible, which we discovered was Siobhan’s professional
networks, our own individual personal networks and expertise, and a few
connections within the local skincare industry. This links with
*Sarasvathy (2022)*, whereby ‘effectual reasoning encourages
entrepreneurs to begin with the means at hand, leveraging their existing
skills, networks, and resources, rather than waiting for ideal
conditions. This mindset anchored our approach in actionable
decision-making, allowing us to focus on what we could achieve
immediately with the resources at hand.

Reflecting on my WIL experience, it is clear the lean start-up framework
was the most beneficial in guiding our team along our entrepreneurial
journey. Our emphasis on the theoretical approach “build-measure-learn”
experimentation from *Blank (2013*), allowed us to rapidly test
assumptions and iteratively refine our ideas based on customer feedback,
working on validating lactoferrin’s potential applications in skincare.
It became apparent we had been over-prioritising internal analysis
rather than real-world validation, following feedback from Jack after
our A1 presentation in week 5. In response, we pivoted our approach,
shifting from hypothetical strategy development to rapid customer
discovery. This is where our team thoroughly adopted the lean start-up
mindset, designing three visual MVP concepts representing different
value propositions, anti-aging, anti-acne, and hydration. This was then
categorised into moisturiser, sunscreen or serums, after Siobhan
mentioned Lactoferrin provided more benefits within leave-on products,
rather than wash-off products. These MVP product concepts were displayed
in our survey, which were distributed to 53 participants across
Brisbane, including university students and beauty retail professionals,
gathering feedback that directly informed our next MVP iterations. This
process allowed us to identify which concepts resonated with different
segments and refine our approach based on real-world insights.
Personally, the lean start-up process helped me remain grounded, and
remind me that successful ventures are not built on hard plans, but
these trial and error processes, ultimately becoming the most
transformative approach for how I understood entrepreneurship within a
real life application.

Complimenting the lean start-up framework, the design thinking framework
was utilised to ground our work in empathy towards customers pain
points, needs and desires. We followed a cyclical process of
‘*empathising, defining, ideating, prototyping,* and *testing*’ each
encouraging a deep understanding of the problem space (*Jaskyte, 2022*).
After discussion with Siobhan at the beginning of the WIL project, we
created a timeline of the processes to pursue. We began this process by
*empathising*, through conducting interviews and mapping customer
journeys to understand the experiences, needs, and frustrations of
different skincare users. Our team completed one-on-one interviews with
a total of 30 participants, 14 women, 13 men, and 3 beauty retail
professionals. Prior to conducting these interviews, our assumptions
were that women would prioritise anti-aging benefits, men would be
largely uninterested in skincare, and beauty retail professionals would
be intrigued by the benefits surrounding lactoferrin. However, after
mapping insights using empathy mapping to inspect each segment’s
thoughts, feelings, behaviours, pains, and gains*,* it was clear we
discovered underlying needs that were not initially apparent. These were
found to be that women prioritised gentle, effective products with
hydration and simplicity, relying on reviews and social proof. Men
valued convenience and simple, evidence-based routines. Beauty retail
professionals focused on clear messaging, client feedback, and
scientifically backed ingredients like lactoferrin. This process allowed
us to challenge our assumptions and highlight our internal biases,
ultimately reinforcing the importance of early validation. Conducting
interviews and synthesising the findings deepened my understanding of
how critical empathy and iterative feedback are in designing solutions
that genuinely resonate with target audiences. Personally, this
experience has shown me that in future entrepreneurial or professional
roles, I will prioritise early customer engagement and evidence-based
decision-making, ensuring that strategies and innovations are grounded
in real-world insights rather than assumptions.

***The Future***

The key takeaway from this WIL practical experience is the importance of
understanding target audiences, testing and managing concepts, and using
real world data to guide decision making, all skills which are directly
applicable to a future career trajectory in marketing. For example,
conducting both consumer and professional interviews for Eclipse taught
me how to identify key motivators, preferences, and pain points, which
in respective to marketing, can inform product positioning, campaign
strategy and market segmentation. Iterative testing and the challenging
of assumptions throughout the WIL experience, specifically in regards to
the MVP’s and survey questions, showed me the importance of grounding
ideas in evidence-based insights, which can correlate to driving
engagement and building brand trust from a marketing aspect.

***Course Recommendations***

The most valued aspect of this course for me is the ability to apply
theoretical knowledge and frameworks, in real practical venture
settings. Where previously mentioned frameworks move beyond abstract
ideas and are tested in practice. As of now, this course has been the
first opportunity for me to do so, and has expanded my perspective on
how theory informs practice. However, the following suggestions have
been made to improve this course to compliment the placements:

1.  It is clear this course is self-guided, which encouraged me to take
    ownership of my learning and manage my time effectively. However, I
    think the course could be improved by providing more examples of how
    previous students approached their placements, which would help set
    expectations and inspire strategies for tackling challenges. This
    could be done through Zoom sessions with previous students who
    benefited from the course or by sharing their personal statements,
    similar to Siobhan’s experience.

2.  Building on this, I suggest implementing more structured reflection
    checkpoints throughout the placement. Scheduled opportunities to
    review progress and challenges would help consolidate learning and
    bridge the gap between theory and practice. While foundational
    knowledge of the frameworks was assumed at the start of the course,
    applying them effectively in a real-world context with Eclipse
    proved more challenging than I anticipated.

3.  I also suggest pairing teams so that two teams are mutually
    accountable for each other’s progress, which fosters regular
    check-ins to review milestones and provide feedback to each other.
    This would also prove interesting if two placement groups were
    working with entirely different ventures, allowing students to gain
    insight into how two distinct businesses approach challenges, make
    decisions, and apply entrepreneurial frameworks, ultimately
    enhancing learning through comparison and reflection.

**Diary Entries**

**Diary Entry \#1 \| 13<sup>th</sup> August**

Prior to commencing the course, my understanding of entrepreneurship is
that it is the process of identifying opportunities, creating value, and
turning ideas into viable ventures. I have had a bit of exposure to
theory of design thinking, effectuation, and lean start-up, however I
have yet to apply this knowledge in a practical setting. As I start this
course, I’m hoping to deepen my understanding of the entrepreneurial
mindset, not just how to start a business, but how to think creatively,
test assumptions, and adapt ideas through real-world learning.

After being pitched several start-up ventures, I was immediately drawn
to Eclipse because it offered clear structure and room for innovation.
The venture has strong foundations, prior development, and clear goals,
with an evident sense of passion from the CEO Siobhan Coster. From there
I met like-minded individuals where we formed a team. Eloise was chosen
as team captain due to her strong sense of goal setting and organisation
skills, while we divided the other roles based on our individual
strengths. I took responsibility for researching Eclipse’s positioning,
competitor landscape, and consumer trends in the APAC region. Other team
members focused on methodology design, problem interviews, and
timelines. Ultimately, our collective goal was to validate lactoferrin’s
value proposition, and whether its strongest market fit would be
reflected in the anti-acne, anti-aging, or anti-inflammatory sector.

At this stage, our approaches reflect Effectuation theory, where we
begin identifying our ‘means’ of skills, connections, and tools already
at our disposal. Reflecting back, this mindset helped us work with
uncertainty, using what we had rather than waiting for perfect
information.

**Diary Entry \#2 \| 1<sup>st</sup> September**

Our team delivered our A1 presentation for Eclipse Ingredients, marking
an important checkpoint for both myself and the team in understanding
how to apply entrepreneurial tools in real world venture context.
Preparing for this milestone helped us move beyond surface level
research, and start critically analysing and delving into Eclipse’s
market validation process for lactoferrin in skincare (Phase 1). As
mentioned in Diary Entry \#1, our biggest assumption was assuming our
biggest challenge would come from identifying which value proposition
(market segment), would resonate most with B2B partners. However, after
our first meeting with Siobhan (after establishing a recurring 30-minute
meeting once a week to ensure consistent feedback) it became clear that
before testing value propositions, we needed to fully understand
Eclipse’s resources, networks and strengths, prompting us to form a
means Inventory. We found Eclipse currently has gaps in market data,
with no clear product-market fit within the skincare industry.

Our immediate learning was how useful the Business Model Canvas (BMC)
can be as a shared visual framework. Building it together helped us see
how each component like value proposition, partners, and revenue
streams, connects to Eclipse’s long-term goal of entering the APAC
skincare market. Upon reflection, this deepened my understanding of how
assumptions, structure, and collaboration interact in entrepreneurial
projects.

**Diary Entry \#3 \| 3<sup>rd</sup> September**

Our team received our A1 presentation marks, and scored 17/20, which was
a strong result and kept the group motivated. The feedback from Jack was
valuable, in particular to shift our focus from prioritising internal
analysis to external validation. This made us focus on more customer
driven results, rather than research heavy analysis. We had initially
planned to start interviews around Week 5, but this advice prompted us
to prioritise early customer discovery and real-world validation before
refining the BMC any further.

This aligned well with our ongoing feedback (email correspondence) from
Siobhan, who reviewed our first draft of interview questions. She
encouraged us to keep questions open ended to avoid leading participants
into answers and to focus on past behaviour as a stronger predictor of
future actions. For example, asking when participants last tried a new
product, what drew them to it, and how they decided to purchase it.
Siobhan’s guidance also led us to reframe our outreach strategy and
conduct interviews as university researchers, rather than approaching
brands on behalf of Eclipse.

From this process, I learned it is vital to have the mindset of
‘validation must drive design’, not follow it, and that we must test and
validate assumptions early before committing to a fixed direction to
ensure our decisions are driven by real customer insights rather than
internal speculation. Moving forward, our focus will be conducting
interviews with a variety of potential stakeholders, such as women
(16+), men, and beauty retail workers, to refine our understanding of
customer pain points, to utilise these insights and guide Eclipse’s next
steps in identifying the strongest market fit for lactoferrin in
skincare.

**Diary Entry \#4 \| 15<sup>th</sup> September**

Our team completed our customer and professional interviews, speaking to
a total of 30 participants across all age ranges: 14 women, 13 men, and
3 beauty retail professionals. Prior to conducting interviews, we
assumed women would prioritise anti-aging benefits, men would be largely
uninterested in skincare beyond convenience, and beauty retail
professionals would be intrigued by the idea of the ingredient
lactoferrin. This was however challenged and we found some interesting
results in regards that woman valued gentleness and hydration over
anti-aging, and rely heavily on reviews and social proof before
purchasing. Men, while still preferring convenience, were more open to
evidence based and natural ingredients more than we had assumed,
particularly if recommended by partners or friends. Retail Professionals
were enthusiastic of lactoferrin, provided there was evidence of
benefits.

Mapping these insights using empathy mapping allowed us to inspect each
segments thoughts and feelings, clarifying their underlying needs that
made not have been clear originally. From this process, I learned that
assumptions can mislead us if not tested. It is clear that the
real-world data we had collected has challenged and brought to light out
internal biases. As mentioned prior, this reinforced the importance of
early validation and iterative design, ensuring our approach to
Eclipse’s market entry aligns with the actual behaviours and needs of
both consumers and industry partners.

**Table of Empathy Mapping**

| **Segment** | **Says** | **Thinks** | **Does** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| *Women (16+)* | “I want products that are gentle but effective.” “I check ingredients before buying.” “Glow and avoiding breakouts are my biggest focus.” “If it was reasonably priced and had great reviews, yes.” “Gentleness first.” | Wants products that suit lifestyle (fast, convenient). Natural/science-backed ingredients build trust. Prefers gentle yet effective products. Seeks social proof before purchase. Prioritises hydration, simplicity, and visible results. | Researches online. Buys mid-range products (\$40–70). Uses daily skincare routines. Reads TikTok reviews. Shops at Mecca, Priceline, Chemist Warehouse. Avoids harsh actives. |
| *Men* | “I just use soap.” “Convenience and effectiveness matter.” “Price is important.” “I’d try it if someone gave it to me.” “I’d buy it if sports guys advertised it.” | Skincare is optional and feminine-coded.

**Diary Entry \#5 \| 9<sup>th</sup> – 15<sup>th</sup> October**

At this stage, our team focused on consumer validation through surveys
and concept testing. Before distributing the surveys, we sought feedback
from Jack. Initially, our questions included both product and
brand-level assumptions, but Jack advised that we focus on product-level
concepts first, testing 2–3 potential value propositions visually rather
than diving into branding prematurely. He emphasized that choices and
rankings generate the most actionable data and that surveys can
simultaneously test multiple MVP variations. This guidance shifted my
perspective, I realized our initial approach risked overcomplicating
data collection and might not reveal which concepts resonated most with
consumers.

Following this feedback, we collaboratively refined our survey
questions, Eloise designed the survey, and from then on, I developed the
flyers to promote participation for the survey. Eloise and Bella created
mock product concepts to test potential value propositions visually.
Over the next few days, we distributed flyers in a variety of locations
such as shopping centres, university bathroom stalls, public parks, bus
stops, and online skincare groups. So far, we’ve gathered responses from
53 participants, providing us with a large variety of consumer insights.

From this process, I learned the value of iterative testing and multiple
touchpoints, in that real-world exposure reveals how consumers respond
to concepts differently than expected. Looking ahead, our next steps
involve B2B outreach to APAC cosmetic brands via LinkedIn, targeting
product development managers to understand sourcing and validation
processes. We will also test the three value propositions with guidance
and feedback from local aestheticians. These activities will extend our
validation from consumers to industry partners, ensuring our insights
guide actionable, market-aligned strategies for Eclipse.
