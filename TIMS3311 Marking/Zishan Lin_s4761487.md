## **Reflection**

This time, WIL allowed me to put the ideas I had in class into a real
environment for the first time to try (Work-Integrated Learning
Australia, n.d.). Our project is Aloe Vita. At first, I always thought
of making a “seemingly complete” plan. But soon I discovered that what
was truly useful was to put people at the center first. We started by
watching the founder’s speech and reviewing public materials to clarify
the issues regarding the product, money, and the team. Then we
communicated repeatedly with the founder about the approach, drew out
step by step what the users think, and incorporated it into the plan and
presentation.

What had the greatest impact on me was realizing that we have to figure
out exactly what users care about, rather than rushing to add various
ancillary functions to the product (for instance, different flavors and
different effects). I also encountered many difficulties during the
process. For instance, when I was giving a speech, I got nervous, had a
strong accent, spoke fast, and the key points tended to get mixed up.
Later, my teammates and I practiced many times, constantly correcting
our mistakes and setting keywords to keep the right rhythm. The final
presentation went much more smoothly than expected, which also gave me
more confidence.

This WIL brought me gains on both ends: the collaboration and trust
within the team, as well as the offline connections with entrepreneurs.
In terms of the team: during the process of clarifying the division of
labor, giving mutual comments, and working together to catch up on
progress, the trust and cooperation within the team were gradually
consolidated. We also became good partners in daily life. On the other
hand, after communicating with entrepreneurs, I gained a clearer
understanding of how early-stage teams can focus on key points and move
forward quickly under tight resource constraints, and where to look for
suitable partners.

At the very beginning, my understanding of innovation and
entrepreneurship was rather “textbook”: making a business model diagram
and preparing a report felt complete. The research mainly relied on
simple questionnaires and lacked systematic methods. While doing it, I
found that I couldn’t get truly useful information in this way; many
answers were guided by how I asked.

Now I have three obvious changes. First, I use an empathy map to listen
to the thoughts of target customers and to see when and where the
product needs improvement (Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.). Second,
I design a better questionnaire. It was adjusted from being long and
circuitous at the beginning to short and clear questions. From now on, I
will ask fewer questions like “Do you like it?” and more behavioral
questions like “When did you last buy it, and why did you buy it?” Such
answers are closer to real behavior and better guide my next steps
(SurveyMonkey, n.d.). Third, after completing the first version of the
questionnaire, I ask friends to conduct a small think-aloud pilot to
test if there are any problems with the questions; once the direction is
confirmed, I reach more target customers to complete the survey. I keep
items as simple and semi-open as needed and avoid leading wording
(Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, 2021). These practices
turned sudden inspirations into well-grounded conclusions. For instance,
when discussing packaging, we no longer focus only on whether it looks
good, but on whether it is more easily noticed and whether it can make
people more willing to place an order. Next, I will continue with this
line of thinking to conduct interviews and verify the conjectures step
by step—ideally using small controlled tests when possible (Kohavi et
al., 2009).

The three difficulties I encountered were: an inaccurate initial version
of the questionnaire, a tight task schedule, and poor oral English with
on-site nervousness. First, the initial questionnaire had repetitive and
leading questions, and it was too long, which made it tiring and
time-consuming to complete. We first asked a few friends to try filling
it out and to think aloud while answering (parts they didn’t understand,
parts they found wordy, and so on). Based on their feedback, we
condensed questions and removed leading phrasing, changed items to
behavioral wording where possible (for example, “When was your last
purchase, and why did you buy it?”), kept the answering time within 3–5
minutes, and added a “No such experience/Not applicable” option. The
revised version worked well: completion rates and valid answers
significantly improved, and our analysis became smoother (Office for
Health Improvement and Disparities, 2021; SurveyMonkey, n.d.). Second,
for a while, the due dates for research, PPTs, pitch practice, and other
courses were all crammed together. Everyone felt there was not enough
time. After discussion, we decided to prioritize by importance: start
with the parts that have the greatest impact on the conclusion, such as
data and key findings, and put visual polish aside. We also made a
simple schedule, and everyone reported progress every day; if someone
needed help, they could get it. In this way, by the last week, the pace
wasn’t so hectic. Finally, during my first practice speech, I was so
nervous that I spoke very fast and the key points were easily scattered.
My spoken English was not very good either, which made some words hard
for others to understand. Later, I broke down the speech into several
paragraphs, each highlighting one key message and supported by keywords,
which helped me control the pace. This speech was also the most
successful one I have ever given. We also conducted several rounds of
Q&A simulations with classmates acting as questioners so everyone was
prepared. Before the official presentation, our group arrived five hours
early to rehearse and check the equipment. After everything was ready,
we felt at ease. These problems are very common, but after this
experience I know how to handle and solve them efficiently in the
future.

This experience made it clear that I enjoy doing product research and
market insight—transforming fragmented feedback, data, and observations
into useful recommendations. I enjoy this process and am willing to
continue improving my expression and communication skills for it.
Whether I do product development or consulting in the future, this way
of working will always be my advantage.

What I value most is that this course places us in an environment with
real problems and genuine feedback. We are no longer just writing
reports; we need to communicate with people, obtain evidence, and make
practical suggestions. Teamwork also felt very real: some people in the
team conducted research, some made presentations, and some controlled
the progress; we covered for one another. All of this made me feel one
step closer to real work. Here are three suggestions: First, the school
could offer more channels—such as business-related professors or
founders from outside the school—so it’s easier to reach people we don’t
usually contact; this makes our questionnaires more valuable and helps
us find the right respondents faster. Second, provide questionnaire
templates that show how to avoid leading responses, since many of us
haven’t learned survey design systematically. Third, share some failure
cases to help us understand the reasons for failure and avoid the same
mistakes next time. The above are my summaries and reflections for this
semester.

**Diary 1:**

Today is August 18th. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, our
group held a zoom meeting to discuss the direction of the next research.
Based on the information we found online and the founder's last speech,
we have summarized some questions and sent the speech to the founder in
the hope of getting responses to the relevant questions. The issue is
probably related to the product, funds and the founding team. Today we
received an email reply from the founder. So our group attempted a
product marketing strategy to analyze this product. Finally, we decided
to use Empathy Mapping and Journey Mapping in the ppt. The greatest gain
today is learning these two methods. In simple terms, an empathy map is
about thinking from the user's perspective. What users see, hear, think
and do, what is bad and what they think is good. The user journey map is
like a subway line map, outlining the entire path from a user's
recognition of a product to their understanding, trial use, payment, and
retention. At each stop, see where we might get stuck and how we can
make changes to avoid it. I feel this is a bit like understanding where
each monster is and its solution before clearing a level or fighting
monsters, making it easier for us to clear the level.

**Diary 2：**

Today is August 24th. On the 20th, our group determined which part of
the ppt each person was responsible for and which part of the
presentation each person would be in charge of during the class
presentation. The task section I was assigned in the ppt and
presentation was Methodology&Approach. On the 22nd, Leah (the founder)
followed the members of the two groups in the team who chose this
product for a zoom Q&A session. After the Q&A session, we made revisions
and improvements to the ppt. On the 23rd, each of us began to write our
own part of the speech. After finishing it, we all watched each other
and offered suggestions for improvement, thus roughly completing the
revision of the speech draft. Finally, today we have determined the
final ppt, added the required reference list at the end of the ppt, and
submitted it. I have completed the production of the ppt and the speech
draft over the past few days. In the coming days, we plan to conduct
multiple mock speeches, and each person should read the content of the
part they are responsible for thoroughly. For me, oral English is my
weak point, so my group members have been helping me correct my
pronunciation. Thank you very much for meeting them.

**Diary 3：**

Today is September 3rd. Our group successfully completed the speech the
day before yesterday. Immediately after that, we planned to start
working on the questions for the questionnaire survey. We also
discovered a drink with the same name as aloe vita, but this drink looks
very ordinary. Today, the scores for the speech have been announced. I'm
very glad that our group has achieved excellent results and is worthy of
everyone's daily efforts. So tonight, we made another effort and held a
meeting on the questions of the questionnaire survey. After discussion,
we pieced together a questionnaire survey. However, we found that this
questionnaire survey was not good enough. Many of the questions were
quite similar, and some of them had the intention of dominating their
responses. So we have listed some of the questions and hope to raise
them when discussing with leah on the 5th. During the revision, we added
"Do you like this drink?" Change it to "When was the last time you drank
a functional drink?" Why choose it?" And "If we change the packaging to
pink, would you buy it?" What was the last time you bought a certain
drink because of its good-looking packaging? What were you thinking at
that time? A series of modifications will be made to obtain more
accurate consumer intentions. This also taught me how to better set up
questionnaire survey questions.

**Diary 4：**

Today is September 15th. On the 5th, leah provided some revision
suggestions for our survey. Through one of her works, we made a lot of
modifications to this survey. We have modified some of the short-answer
questions into single-choice and multiple-choice questions to shorten
the answering time and improve the efficiency of answering. Also, reduce
the number of questions and keep the answering time within about three
minutes. Merge repetitive or similar questions to make the answers more
fluent. Today, we also started to try out the picture design of product
packaging and sent several sketches to Leah, asking her to refer to them
and point out a more appropriate direction. Our next plan is to identify
a portion of our target customers and ask them to complete the survey.
Then tally up the survey results and share them with leah. The last step
is to prepare the interview questions to be produced next based on the
results.

**Diary 5：**

Today is October 8th. Invited by leah, our group went to participate in
the FaBA Growth Hub Showcase. During the event, we met leah. Usually, we
meet on zoom, but this was our first offline communication. Everyone is
very excited. We also met members of another group. During the activity,
we exchanged our progress and achievements with each other. And we also
listened to the speeches given by leah and other founders on it. Through
their speeches, I found that leah's products are relatively new. The
speeches of other founders also provided references: at different stages
and with different focuses, but the common point was that the goals were
clear and the pace was tight, which was very inspiring for our
subsequent research and collaboration. I think this activity has exposed
me to aspects that I had never encountered before. Thank you, leah, for
the invitation. Our subsequent plan is to each find target customers for
interviews, and each person should find at least four target customers.
Since there are many questions in the interview, it is necessary to try
to find clients with a stronger willingness to conduct the interview.
