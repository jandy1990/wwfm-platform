**Introduction**

The Work Integrated Learning (WIL) experience in TIMS3311 was one of the
most practical and engaging parts of my degree. My group partnered with
Eclipse, a biotechnology company led by CEO Siobhan, who tasked us with
exploring how Lactoferrin, a natural protein with antibacterial and
anti-inflammatory properties, could be incorporated into skincare
products. This project gave me the opportunity to combine creativity,
research and consumer insight to help a real company explore a new
market. Throughout the project, I developed stronger research,
communication and problem-solving skills and gained confidence in
applying entrepreneurial thinking to real-world challenges. Beyond the
tasks, the WIL experience also taught me a lot about myself, teamwork
and what it is like to work in a startup.

**Overall WIL Experience**

Through the WIL experience, I learned a lot about how I work best and
what motivates me. I discovered that I like to take the lead on
assignments and work best when there are clear deadlines and structure.
I find it harder when tasks are undefined, so this experience taught me
how to organise my work more effectively using weekly plans, to-do lists
and role tables to keep myself and my team on track. I also realised how
much I enjoy brainstorming with others. Working with my friends Paige,
Bella, Ruby and Crystal-Rose made collaboration feel natural and sharing
ideas together helped spark creativity and motivation.

One of the biggest personal lessons I learned was how to handle negative
feedback. In the past, I found criticism hard to take, but during the
WIL I came to appreciate it as a chance to learn and improve. When Jack
suggested adding product mock-ups to the survey and removing some of the
questions, I was actually very appreciative of his feedback. Instead of
feeling defensive, I saw it as extremely helpful and constructive as it
made our survey clearer and more engaging. Because I was working with
friends, receiving feedback felt supportive rather than discouraging and
it helped me refine my ideas and grow more confident in my work.
Positive feedback from Siobhan also gave me a real sense of
accomplishment.

I faced some challenges too. Balancing WIL tasks with my university
workload and working full time required careful time management.
Learning new tools like survey platforms were stressful at times.
Disagreements in the team about design choices, tested my ability to
listen, compromise and find solutions. Working with a startup was also
unpredictable, to manage this I focused on listening actively every
weekly catchup, taking notes to summarise to the group to make sure
everyone was aligned and staying flexible and patient in a changing
environment.

Looking back, I would have asked for feedback on the groups work and
communication earlier. Overall, the WIL experience was one of the most
valuable parts of my degree. It taught me how to lead with structure,
collaborate with empathy and adapt to real-world challenges. It also
gave me confidence in my ability to work professionally within a startup
environment and reinforced how I enjoy creative, hands-on
problem-solving.

**Networks Established**

My team was made up of my friends Paige, Bella, Ruby and Crystal-Rose,
which made working together enjoyable and comfortable. We already had a
strong sense of trust and communication, which helped us collaborate
effectively throughout the project. Through the WIL experience, we also
connected with Siobhan, the CEO of Eclipse, the startup we partnered
with. Speaking with her gave us valuable insight into how a small
biotechnology company operates and how leadership and innovation work in
real-world settings. Networking through meetings helped me understand
how startups work, and the skills needed to succeed. Building this
connection allowed us to see how professional networks can open
opportunities for learning and future collaboration. Overall, I gained a
better understanding of the value of teamwork and how forming
relationships can enhance both personal and professional growth.

**Knowledge, Insights and Skills Gained**

Before WIL

Before WIL, I had limited practical experience in entrepreneurship. I
understood basic concepts like Lean Startup, MVP design and Stakeholder
Mapping but I had not applied them in real situations. Previously, I had
worked on academic projects where we had to create business ideas and
presented them to peers, but I had not worked with a real CEO or
business to test ideas. My teamwork experience was mostly in structure
academic environments.

During WIL

Entrepreneurial Concepts

During this journey, I learned how to apply Lean Startup principles,
including making prototypes and testing ideas quickly. I also learned
how important it is to get feedback from consumers and adjust based on
what they say. I gained experience in business modelling and designing
value propositions, which helped me understand how to align ideas with
market needs.

Practical Skills

Throughout the WIL experience, I developed a range of practical and
entrepreneurial skills that I can carry into my future career. I learned
how to create and refine product mock-ups, surveys and how to apply
frameworks like the Business Model Canvas (BMC and empathy mapping to
real-world companies and situations. Using the BMC helped me break down
Eclipse’s value proposition, customer segments and revenue streams,
giving me a clearer understanding of how all parts of a business connect
strategically. Empathy mapping, on the other hand, helped our team think
from the consumer’s perspective which directly informed our product
design and decisions.

alt="A document with text on it AI-generated content may be incorrect." /><img src="media/image3.png" style="width:3.24514in;height:1.83542in" />Working
within a dynamic and motivated team further helped me develop essential
collaboration and conflict resolution skills. When our group had
different opinions about product direction or design, I learned to
actively listen, facilitate discussion and find compromises that suited
both creative and practical goals. This experience improved my emotional
intelligence and leadership ability – skills that are crucial for an
entrepreneurial or innovation-focused career. Learning how to clearly
explain ideas, justify decisions and respond to feedback helped me build
professional confidence and taught me how to engage effectively.

Insights

A key insight I gained was that innovation requires flexibility and
adaptability. Not every idea works out as planned. For example, we
initially considered a lactoferrin-based cleanser, but this wasn’t
feasible because Lactoferrin needs to remain on the skin for a prolonged
time to be effective. This experience showed me that entrepreneurship is
about experimentation and knowing when to pivot. Reflecting ideas from
lean startup and effectuation theory.

I also learned that risk-taking and experimentation are essential for
innovation. Through testing designs, adjusting surveys and refining our
marketing approach, I saw how valuable feedback loops are for
improvement. This taught me to see mistake not as failures but as
opportunities to learn and adapt.

These lessons will strongly influence my future career. Whether in
innovation, marketing or product development, I now feel more confident
in leading projects, staying adaptable and solving problems creatively.

Future Application

The skills and knowledge I gained will help me in future projects or
careers in entrepreneurship and innovation. I am more confident in
managing projects, working with diverse teams and adjusting ideas based
on feedback. I have improved my ability to present ideas and will carry
forward lessons about flexibility, risk-taking and balancing creativity
with practical needs in any future work.

**Value and Suggestions**

I valued being able to learn in class to real-world startup. Mentorship
from Siobhan was an extremely helpful jumpstart into what it takes to
strive in a real-world startup. I also appreciated learning about the
challenges and problem-solving skills that it takes. My communication,
teamwork and adaptability skills grew a lot during this WIL experience.

Suggestions for Improvement

While the WIL experience was highly valuable, there are a few ways it
could be improved to support students further. One improvement could be
introducing a mid-way feedback form for students. This would not be
graded but would provide an opportunity for students to share their
progress, challenges or any concerns directly with the teaching team
before the final stages of the placement. Also, it would be a good
option for students who may not feel comfortable joining a call with
Jack, as my group did a few times. This would help ensure that all
students receive the right level of support, even if they prefer to
communicate in writing.

Another helpful addition would be making the reflective diary entries a
weekly submission rather than all at once at the end. Since this
assessment already requires 5 diary entries, submitting them
progressively would allow the teach to follow along with each students
journey and provide feedback in real time. This would encourage students
to regularly assess what they are learning and how they are developing
key skills such as teamwork, communication and problem solving. Having a
structured way to track growth throughout the experience would make it
easier to identify personal strengths and areas for improvement.
Overall, these small adjustments could help the WIL experience even more
engaging, reflective and supportive for future students.

**Conclusion**

The TIMS3311 WIL Experience was both challenging and rewarding. I
learned more about myself, my strengths and areas I can improve. I
gained practical skills in research, innovation, teamwork and
communication. The experience also showed me what working in a startup
in really like, including its challenges and opportunities. The lessons
I learned, the skills I developed and the networks I built will help me
in future projects, jobs and career decisions in innovation and
entrepreneurship.

Reflective Diary Entry 1 - Designing and Conducting Interviews

At the beginning of our WIL project, my group met with Siobhan to plan
our research approach and agreed to focus on three key groups – women
aged 16+, men aged 20+ and beauty retail staff. Since interviewing is
not one of my strongest skills, I volunteered to take the lead on
writing the interview questions. I wrote these questions, focusing on
skincare habits, product perceptions and attitudes toward natural or
science-backed ingredients. After refining the questions from receiving
feedback from Siobhan and my teammates, I divided the interviews based
on demographic focus.

<img src="media/image4.png" style="width:5.51597in;height:2.73681in" />

I conducted three male interviews: Caige (21), a fourth-year electrical
apprentice; Dylan (25), a university student; and Wayne (62), a General
Manager at Fort Vale Australia. They each offered unique perspectives
shaped by age and lifestyle. Caige valued convivence and price showing
little interest in skincare beyond basic hygiene. Dylan relied on his
partner’s choices but was open to natural, effective ingredients like
lactoferrin. Wayne viewed skincare as feminine and time-consuming,
preferring simplicity for practical reasons. These interviews improved
my confidence and revealed that most men prioritise ease, functionality
and credibility over luxury in skincare. This understanding will
directly inform how our team develops recommendations for positioning
new ingredients like lactoferrin in skincare products. Overall, this
process strengthens my skills in question design, communication and
consumer insight generation and helped me grow more confident in
applying research methods within a real-world business context.

Diary Entry 2 - Empathy Mapping

During the mid-semester break, from 29 September to 5 October, I
independently completed the empathy mapping stage of our project. Before
starting, I used IDEO’s guide “Build Your Creative Confidence: Empathy
Maps” (Kelley, 2018) to understand how to structure qualitative data
through the “say, do, think, feel” framework, followed by identifying
pains and gains. This method helped me analyse the interviews
systematically and avoid being overwhelmed by information.

I created empathy maps for each demographic. Women valued gentleness,
ingredient transparency and authenticity, often guided by social media
recommendations. Men prioritised simplicity, low effort and
affordability with many seeing skincare as optional or partner driven.
Beauty retail staff highlighted education and clear ingredient
communication as crucial for consumer trust.

Working through this process taught me how to translate raw interview
data into meaningful insights and notice behavioural patterns across
demographics. It also strengthened my confidence in qualitative
analysis, empathy-based research and independent problem-solving.
Overall, applying IDEO’s method improve both the quality of our findings
and my ability to think critically and creatively about user
experiences.

Diary Entry 3 - Survey Questions + Product Mock Ups

<img src="media/image8.png" style="width:1.47361in;height:1.61875in"
alt="A cream bottle with a black cap AI-generated content may be incorrect." />For
this stage of the project, I worked on refining our consumer survey and
developing visual mock-ups for the skincare products. Bella and I met
with Jack, who provided feedback that our original survey draft had too
many questions, which could discourage responses. Based on his advice,
we shortened and simplified the survey to make it more engaging and
user-friendly. To help participants visualise product options, I created
mock-ups for sunscreen and serum, while Bella designed moisturiser
mock-ups for each product category: science-backed, natural and organic
and luxury and lifestyle. I also created a poll in our shared Google Doc
to decide as a team how we could want to conduct the survey – whether
through social media, in store drop ins or a combination of both. After
discussing, most of us agreed that combining online and in-person
approaches would help capture a wider range of responses. Additionally,
I drafted a flyer to promote the survey around campus, which Paige later
redesigned into two polished final versions that looked amazing. This
process helped me understand how to balance feedback, collaboration and
design thinking to create effective research materials that attract
participants and generate quality insights.

Reflective Diary Entry 4 - Creating Survey

Initially, I created the survey using SurveyMonkey, as it seemed like a
simple and accessible tool for gathering responses. However, after
developing the draft, I quickly realised that SurveyMonkey required a
paid subscription to access essential features. It also didn’t look very
professional, which was not ideal for a university project. I wanted the
survey to appear clear, trustworthy and well-presented so that people
would take it seriously and give thoughtful answers.

After talking with my group, I decided to switch to Qualtrics instead.
This platform was available through University of Queensland and didn’t
cost anything to use. It looked much more professional and included the
UQ banner, which made it appear official and academic. I also found
Qualtrics much easier to use and customise. It allowed me to design the
layout and include the project mock-ups we created for the sunscreen,
serum and moisturiser options.

Using Qualtrics made the survey looked cleaner and easier to complete,
which should help us get better-quality responses. Overall, this
experience taught me how important it is to choose the right tool when
creating surveys. A good platform can make the process faster, look more
professional and encourage more reliable responses. In the future, I
will definitely use Qualtrics again for research projects because it is
simple, effective and gives a much better impression that other free
tools.

Reflective Diary Entry 5 - Conducting Survey

<img src="media/image17.jpeg"
style="width:2.64306in;height:1.98194in" />On Friday, the
10<sup>th</sup> of October, we received confirmation from Siobhan that
our survey looked great but needed a few small changes. I made these
adjustments right now to finalise the survey before sharing it. Once it
was ready, I sent the link to my family and friends over Friday and
Saturday to start collecting responses.

On Sunday, the 12<sup>th</sup> of October, Paige and I went to
Indooroopilly Shopping Centre to conduct in-person surveys. We visited
Mecca, Sephora and the Body Shop to speak directly with shoppers and the
employees. Our goal was to get honest opinions and insights from people
who are familiar with skincare products. Throughout the day, we managed
to get 10 participants to stop, chat with us and complete the survey.

The experience was really positive and gave us useful feedback. At
Mecca, several employees recommended the brand Dr. Jart, saying it is
very well-known and extremely effective. All the staff spoke very highly
of its products, which helped us understand what customers and beauty
professionals value in skincare.

Conducting the survey in person helped us engage with people more
meaningfully and gather richer insights than we could have online alone.
It also gave us more confidence in our project, as we saw genuine
interest from shoppers and staff. Overall, this experience taught me how
valuable face-to-face engagement can be when gathering real-world
feedback for research projects
