Assessment 2: Critical Reflection – WIL Experience
with Stormboy Australia
Introduction
During my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement with Stormboy Australia, I had the chance to apply
entrepreneurial theory and practice in a small, family-run screen printing and embroidery company.
Stormboy has established a solid reputation for providing local Brisbane customers with prompt,
individualized service, but like many small businesses, it is coming under more and more pressure from big
online rivals. I started my placement with an emphasis on process efficiency, but after some introspection,
feedback, and theoretical application, I started to think more about creating opportunities and being
innovative. My personal development, the entrepreneurial frameworks used, and the innovation pathways
found using the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and the ensuing MVP development are all critically
reflected in this essay.
1. The Overall WIL Experience
Personal Lessons and Challenges
I focused on operational efficiency at first, which meant cutting down on equipment downtime and speeding
up workflows. These efforts did help with some small problems, but they didn't make Stormboy's business
stand out. Both my boss and my teacher told me to go beyond optimization and start thinking like an
entrepreneur. This change in focus from "working faster" to "creating new value" was a turning point for me.
One of the biggest problems was finding a balance between what clients wanted and trying new things. I
often didn't want to suggest new ideas to a traditional family business. But the Lean Startup principle of
"build–measure–learn" (Ries, 2011) taught me that new ideas can start out small and cheap. I lowered the
risk and got real insights by introducing testable ideas instead of making big changes.
Looking back, I would test ideas with clients sooner rather than later. Early validation might have shown
that customers were interested in subscription services sooner. The experience taught me that being an
entrepreneur is a process that changes based on what works and what doesn't, not on perfect plans.
Networks and Value Creation
During my time at Stormboy, I worked with the owner, the operations manager, and local businesses like
coffee shops, gyms, and salons. Through them, I learned about the common problems small businesses face,
like demand that's hard to predict, cash flow issues, and the growing need to be more sustainable. These

helped me understand that innovation isn't a solo thing, but a group effort. This fits with Chesbrough's
(2003) idea that sharing knowledge between companies can improve results.
2. New Knowledge, Insights, and Practical Skills Gained
The Past: Baseline Knowledge and Skills
Before this course, my understanding of business creation was mostly textbook stuff. I knew Schilling’s
(2023) innovation types and had read about Design Thinking (Brown, 2009), Lean Startup (Ries, 2011), and
Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2008), but I hadn't used them in the real world. I used to think innovation was just
about doing things faster, not about being different. I was good at design, but not at testing if my ideas were
any good.
Key Learnings and Application of Entrepreneurial Frameworks
1. Design Thinking – Empathy and Reframing
By talking to Stormboy's clients (See Appendix:Interviews 1 - 22), I found out that their biggest problem
was the required minimum order. Small businesses often needed just a few uniforms, but they had to buy a
lot. Using Design Thinking, I changed the question we were asking from “How can Stormboy be faster?” to
“How can Stormboy create ongoing value for small clients?” (Brown, 2009). This led to the idea of
Uniform-as-a-Service (UaaS) which is a subscription where small businesses get uniforms regularly without
having to buy in bulk.
2. Lean Startup – Build–Measure–Learn
Using the Lean Startup method, I treated the UaaS idea as a minimum viable product. I suggested testing it
with five local coffee shops to see if they were interested. They were, because they liked the idea of
predictable costs and flexible ordering. I realized that innovation is about testing ideas, not sticking to a plan
no matter what. This experience showed me that it’s better to learn quickly than to try to do everything
perfectly (Ries, 2011).
3. Effectuation – Starting with Available Means
Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2008) changed how I thought about business creation. I learned to see it as using
the resources you already have. Stormboy already had machines, skilled workers, and loyal clients. We
could use these to innovate without spending a lot of money. We made sure our tests were small, reversible,
and cheap. This helped us turn uncertainty into opportunity.
4. Business Model Canvas – Identifying Systemic Gaps

Making a Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010) (see Figure 1) showed that Stormboy was
good at service but not so good at digital stuff or sustainability. We had gaps in recurring income, CRM
systems, and using eco-friendly materials (see Appendix: Table 1). This helped me change my focus from
quick fixes to long-term innovation plans.
Figure 1: Stormboy Business model canvas (Larger version in Appendix 1)

New Section: MVP Testing and Visual Prototyping (Feedback Integration)
Based on feedback, I made ads to test customer reactions to Stormboy’s new ideas. I created three ads that
looked like they were “coming soon” to suggest where the business could go:
1.​ Uniform-as-a-Service Ad – This ad showed how clients could subscribe monthly (for example, $30
per employee) to get uniforms regularly (see Appendix: Figure 2).​
2.​ Eco-Materials and Repair-Reuse Ad –This ad talked about using sustainable materials (organic
cotton, recycled polyester) and repairing/returning old clothes (see Appendix: Figure 3).​
3.​ Customer Co-Design Ad – This ad invited clients to help create designs through a digital portal with
the slogan “Designed with You.”(see Appendix: Figure 4)​

These ads were meant to make the ideas feel real and start conversations with customers. Early testing
showed that people were most interested in the subscription service and eco-friendly materials.

The Future: Career Trajectory and Impact
This experience changed how I see myself. Now, I'm not just a designer, but someone who turns ideas into
systems that are good for the economy, society, and the environment. I learned that sustainable innovation
requires understanding, testing, and being able to change. I plan to use these lessons in the sustainable
fashion sector, focusing on systems like repair, rental, and material tracking.
This experience confirmed my goal of developing sustainable clothing businesses in Australia, combining
my design skills with business creation to make a difference.
Course Reflection and Improvement Suggestions
The best part of this course was how it mixed theory with doing. Testing, learning, and changing directions.
Feedback from classmates and the instructor helped me open my mind and try new things.
To make the program even better, I suggest:
1.​ Earlier Business Model Canvas workshops — to identify innovation opportunities before
mid-placement.
2.​ Incorporating circular economy frameworks — encouraging sustainable business model innovation.
3.​ Facilitating client co-design sessions early — so students can engage real stakeholders sooner and
generate richer empathy insights.
These enhancements would help future students experience deeper, system-level learning rather than
isolated project tasks.
Conclusion
My Stormboy experience changed my mind about business creation. I learned to see it as a chance to create
instead of just a way to be efficient. By using Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Effectuation with the
Business Model Canvas, I learned to create innovation plans that are structured but flexible. I learned that
real innovation is about designing new systems, relationships, and experiences that benefit everyone.
Through testing, I went from watching how things are done to designing MVPs that test where the business
could go in the future. This has deepened my understanding and shaped my career toward sustainable
business creation.

Reflective Diary Entries
Diary Entry 1 – Initial Impressions and Expectations
During my first week at Stormboy Australia, I spent time watching and learning. The company seemed like
a tight-knit family business with a strong base of local customers. My first job was to follow the embroidery
team to learn their processes and how they handle customers. At first, I equated progress with making things
faster and producing more. I looked closely at what was slowing things down: equipment problems, file
errors, and delays between approving designs and starting production. I believed fixing these issues would
be entrepreneurial.
But as I wrote down what I saw, I realized that Stormboy’s greatest strength—being fast and
affordable—could also be limiting their capacity to progress. Everyone was so busy trying to complete
orders that there wasn't much time to try out new ideas or explore other services. This made me think about
Schilling’s idea of small improvements versus major changes, and I realized I was only thinking about minor
improvements.
When I spoke with the owner, I learned that Stormboy is competing against large online businesses that use
automation and offer very low prices. Stormboy stands out because of its personal touch and relationships,
which can’t be copied by digital services. This suggested that any future progress should build on this
human aspect, rather than just trying to be more efficient.
By the end of the first week, I started to jot down some initial thoughts on how progress could support, not
clash with, Stormboy’s identity. I understood that my original ideas about progress were too limited, which
was a very helpful lesson that influenced the rest of my time there.

Diary Entry 2 – Feedback and Reframing
In Week 3, I presented my initial proposal focused on process optimisation. My lecturer’s feedback was
straightforward: “You’re solving efficiency problems, not creating entrepreneurial opportunities.” Although
challenging to hear, it became a pivotal learning moment. It forced me to confront my tendency to default to
fixing, rather than reimagining.
After reflecting, I revisited Chesbrough’s (2003) concept of open innovation. I realised that entrepreneurship
requires value co-creation, not just internal refinement. I arranged a follow-up meeting with Stormboy’s
owner to explore whether they had considered new business models. Their answer was honest; they were
aware of subscription services and custom portals but hadn’t explored them due to limited time and digital
infrastructure.
This feedback loop taught me to embrace discomfort as part of the learning process. I redefined my goal
from improving processes to exploring new value pathways. Using the “How Might We” framework from
Design Thinking, I reframed my challenge: “How might Stormboy engage customers through continuous
value rather than one-off transactions?” This question became the anchor for my later Business Model
Canvas work.
By the end of Week 3, I recognised that my biggest barrier wasn’t lack of ideas but fear of proposing change
in a traditional business. This insight became essential in developing confidence to lead innovation
conversations in future workplaces.

Diary Entry 3 – Building the Business Model Canvas
Week 4 was when theory met practice. I constructed a Business Model Canvas to visualise how Stormboy
currently operates. Mapping each element; from key resources to revenue streams; revealed gaps that were
not visible before. The canvas showed Stormboy excels in personal service but lacks digital scalability and
formal retention systems.
Through this process, I realised that many of Stormboy’s challenges stemmed from its success; the business
had grown organically but without structural innovation. For example, customer relationships were based on
personal loyalty, not digital tracking or CRM tools. Similarly, marketing relied heavily on word-of-mouth
rather than online channels.
As I filled out the “Value Proposition” block, I saw the opportunity for differentiation: integrating
sustainability and circular economy elements into uniform design. The idea of a “Uniform-as-a-Service”
model emerged; customers could receive uniforms through a subscription, reducing waste and stabilising
revenue.

The BMC helped me communicate insights visually to the team. Instead of long reports, the canvas acted as
a shared language for discussing change. This week marked a turning point where I stopped thinking like a
designer and started thinking like an entrepreneur.

Diary Entry 4 – Customer Insights through Design Thinking
Using Design Thinking, I began conducting empathy interviews with small business clients. I wanted to
understand not just what frustrated them, but what they truly valued. Café owners and salon managers
expressed frustration with minimum order quantities, delayed restocks, and lack of flexibility.
I mapped these insights through empathy and journey maps, identifying key emotional touchpoints — stress
when staff uniforms ran out, satisfaction with personalised service, and anxiety about unpredictable costs.
From this emerged the insight that customers didn’t just want uniforms; they wanted reliability and control.
This discovery reinforced the “Uniform-as-a-Service” idea. Instead of one-off purchases, businesses could
subscribe and receive uniforms as staff numbers changed. The model would reduce upfront costs for clients
and provide Stormboy with steady income.
Applying Design Thinking principles reminded me that innovation starts with empathy, not ideas. The
process shifted my mindset from being solution-driven to being problem-sensitive.

Diary Entry 5 – MVP Ideation and Lean Startup
By Week 6, I applied Lean Startup principles to move from idea to test. I developed a simple MVP proposal
for the subscription service targeting five café clients. The test would involve offering quarterly uniform
updates at a fixed monthly fee.
The process taught me the power of the build–measure–learn loop. I built a mock pricing model, measured
interest through informal client discussions, and learned that while some were hesitant, others were excited
about predictable costs. This data-driven learning validated that small businesses value flexibility over speed
alone.
I also learned the importance of “affordable loss.” Stormboy could test this model without major investment
by leveraging existing machines and client relationships. The owner appreciated that innovation didn’t
necessarily require risk; just structured experimentation.
Through this, I experienced the balance between creativity and practicality that defines entrepreneurship.

Diary Entry 6 – Effectuation in Practice
Week 7 deepened my understanding of Effectuation. Instead of waiting for perfect conditions, I worked with
what Stormboy already had; equipment, loyal clients, and skilled staff. This approach emphasised
“bird-in-hand” thinking: starting with available means to shape new ends.
We brainstormed how existing systems could support innovation. For instance, Stormboy’s embroidery
software could be repurposed for a customer design portal, allowing clients to preview products online.
Similarly, unused production time could be offered for small-batch collaborations with local artists.
Effectuation also encouraged adaptability. When one café client postponed their involvement, I reframed it
as feedback, not failure. I learned to see obstacles as signals to adjust assumptions; embodying the
“lemonade principle” of turning surprises into opportunity.
This mindset shift gave me a sense of entrepreneurial control, transforming uncertainty from fear into fuel.
Diary Entry 7 – Identifying Innovation Gaps
Week 8 involved synthesising findings from the BMC, interviews, and MVP test. I identified recurring
innovation gaps: reliance on one-off transactions, limited sustainability integration, and absence of digital
tools.
I presented these insights to the owner, highlighting opportunities for innovation: developing a CRM,
introducing eco-materials, and formalising client partnerships. The conversation was positive; they
acknowledged the value of structured innovation but were concerned about time.
This discussion helped me appreciate that innovation must fit context; proposing small, iterative changes is
often more realistic than large overhauls. I also learned the importance of stakeholder alignment: innovation
succeeds when framed as mutually beneficial, not disruptive.
Week 8 solidified my role as a bridge between theory and practice; using academic frameworks to create
tangible business value.
Diary Entry 8 – Reflection and Integration
The final week was a period of reflection and integration. I compared my Week 1 assumptions with Week 9
insights and saw a transformation; from efficiency-focused to system-oriented thinking. The WIL
experience taught me that entrepreneurship is iterative, relational, and reflective.
I refined the Business Model Canvas to include proposed innovations: subscription services, sustainability
integration, CRM systems, and artist collaborations. Seeing this future-state canvas beside the original
highlighted the potential impact of design-led change.

Writing my final report allowed me to consolidate theory into practice. Design Thinking gave me empathy,
Lean Startup gave me method, Effectuation gave me courage, and the Business Model Canvas gave me
structure. Together, they shaped a holistic understanding of innovation as both creative and disciplined.
At the end, I felt a sense of ownership; not over outcomes, but over my growth as an entrepreneurial
designer.

A: Lack of communication. We never know when things will actually arrive.
Interview 9 – Hair Salon Owner
Q: Do you currently use Stormboy for uniforms?​
A: Yes, but only for one-off orders.
Q: Why not more often?​
A: Because small orders aren’t easy. It feels like we’re too small to matter.
Q: Would a flexible subscription help?​
A: Definitely. If I could just order new pieces as staff change, I’d be loyal forever.

Q: What do you want most from a supplier?​
A: Feeling like a valued customer, not an afterthought.
Interview 10 – Gym Manager
Q: How do uniforms fit into your business?​
A: They’re essential — staff need to look approachable and consistent.
Q: What’s hard about ordering?​
A: Sizes. Every new hire needs something different, which messes with bulk orders.
Q: Would you pay for a subscription?​
A: For sure. It’d solve size problems because we could just swap as needed.
Q: What do you think of Stormboy?​
A: They’re great — but they need to adapt to small clients like us.
Interview 11 – Non-Profit Manager
Q: Do you order uniforms often?​
A: Only when we can afford them. Bulk orders are tough on our budget.
Q: Would you consider a monthly subscription?​
A: Yes, especially if it spreads the cost.
Q: What matters most in choosing a supplier?​
A: Affordability and alignment with our values.
Q: How do you see innovation in small businesses?​

A: Good quality, but minimum orders are a pain for us.
Q: What’s appealing about subscriptions?​
A: Predictable costs. Start-ups need that stability.

Q: Do you think small businesses value innovation?​
A: Definitely. It’s what keeps us competitive.
Interview 13 – Fabric Supplier Representative
Q: What’s your experience working with small embroidery businesses like Stormboy?​
A: They’re some of our most creative clients, but they struggle with predicting fabric demand, which
affects our own production planning.
Q: How could a subscription or recurring model help from your side?​
A: It would bring consistency. If we knew their monthly fabric needs, we could offer better prices and
reduce waste.
Q: What challenges do you see in supply chain innovation?​
A: Smaller companies often lack the data to forecast properly — they work week-to-week. Innovation
comes from creating that predictability.
Q: Do you think Stormboy could stand out through sustainability?​
A: Absolutely. Eco-certified fabrics and transparent sourcing are becoming key differentiators in B2B
embroidery.
Q: Any advice for young entrepreneurs?​
A: Build long-term supplier relationships. Innovation isn’t just what you sell — it’s how you collaborate.
Interview 14 – Sustainability Consultant
Q: What’s your perspective on sustainability in small creative industries like embroidery?​
A: It’s often overlooked. People think sustainability is only for big brands, but small businesses can
innovate faster.
Q: What would sustainability look like for Stormboy?​
A: They could start with waste reduction — collecting leftover threads or using recycled threads for small
jobs.
Q: How could a uniform subscription model connect to sustainability?​
A: It keeps garments in circulation longer. Repair, reuse, or take-back features could make it circular
instead of linear.
Q: How do you see innovation and sustainability working together?​
A: They’re inseparable now. True innovation creates both profit and purpose.

Q: What advice would you give to a student exploring this?​
A: Always link creativity to systems thinking — don’t just make better products, make better cycles.
Interview 15 – Returning Stormboy Customer
Q: What keeps you coming back to Stormboy?​
A: The personal touch. I can call and talk to someone who actually knows my past orders.
Q: Have you noticed any challenges when reordering?​
A: Sometimes old designs or sizes get lost between systems, which slows things down.
Q: Would a digital or subscription system help you?​
A: Definitely. I’d love a client portal to reorder or tweak designs easily.
Q: What do you value most in a small supplier?​
A: Reliability. If they keep their promises, I stay loyal.
Q: What would make you recommend them more?​
A: More consistency and less back-and-forth paperwork — innovation that saves me time.
Interview 16 – Digital Marketing Consultant
Q: How could a small business like Stormboy better use digital tools?​
A: Automate client communication — things like reorder reminders or a digital mock-up system could save
hours.
Q: How would that tie into innovation?​
A: It changes how customers experience the brand. You move from a service provider to a partner.
Q: What’s your take on the subscription idea?​
A: It’s smart. But it needs strong online management — clients expect to manage everything from their
phones now.
Q: How do small businesses balance creativity with tech adoption?​
A: By starting small — automate what drains time first, then scale up.
Q: What’s the biggest missed opportunity you see in Stormboy’s industry?​
A: Digital storytelling. Showing the “making process” builds emotional value and trust.
Interview 17 – Fashion and Design Student Observer

Q: What drew you to observe Maya’s Stormboy project?​
A: The blend of design and entrepreneurship. It’s a rare mix that goes beyond aesthetics.
Q: What did you learn from watching the process?​
A: That innovation isn’t just invention — it’s reframing. Maya turned a production challenge into a
business opportunity.
Q: How do you see the connection between fashion and business model innovation?​
A: They’re converging. Designers need to think about systems, not just clothes.
Q: What do you admire about the project’s approach?​
A: It stays grounded in real users — café owners, local clients — instead of chasing abstract sustainability
goals.
Q: How has it influenced your own thinking?​
A: I now see entrepreneurship as a design practice — iterative, human-centred, and purpose-driven.
Interview 18 – Local Community Partner (Small Business Network Coordinator)
Q: What kind of role does Stormboy play in the Brisbane small business community?​
A: They’re a go-to for quality uniforms and local collaborations. They represent what small-scale
Australian businesses can do — personal, creative, reliable.
Q: What challenges do they face in the current business environment?​
A: Competition from overseas suppliers. It’s hard to match their prices, but Stormboy wins with service and
customisation.
Q: What would help them innovate further?​
A: Partnering with other local makers. Imagine combining their embroidery with local textile printing or
repair services.
Q: How do you view innovation in small businesses?​
A: It’s survival. When local businesses share resources or customers, they innovate naturally.
Q: Would a subscription service fit within the local ecosystem?​
A: Absolutely. It could tie multiple small businesses together in a steady-value network.
Interview 19 – New Stormboy Employee (Junior Designer)

Q: What was it like joining Stormboy as a new team member?​
A: Exciting but a little overwhelming. There’s so much tradition here — people know what works, but that
can make new ideas hard to introduce.
Q: How do you see innovation inside the company?​
A: It’s starting to grow. The subscription idea has people talking about what else we could do differently.
Q: What’s been the hardest part of learning the job?​
A: Balancing speed with creativity. Everything has to move fast, but you still want the designs to stand out.
Q: What’s something you’d love to see changed?​
A: More digital tools — like design previews clients can see online before production.
Q: How do you feel about sustainability and future directions?​
A: It’s essential. Every young designer I know wants to create things that last.
Interview 20 – Entrepreneurship Program Mentor
Q: How would you describe Maya’s growth through the Stormboy project?​
A: Dramatic. She went from seeing innovation as an efficiency upgrade to understanding it as new value
creation.
Q: What do you think was her biggest learning moment?​
A: The shift when she realised efficiency isn’t innovation — that’s the classic entrepreneurial turning point.
Q: How does her work align with current entrepreneurship theory?​
A: It sits beautifully within Lean Startup and Effectuation frameworks. She applied theory to real-life
uncertainty.
Q: What advice did you give her along the way?​
A: To talk more with customers — because that’s where innovation lives, not in spreadsheets.
Q: What would you say to future students doing WIL placements?​
A: Be brave enough to pivot. That’s where real learning happens.
Interview 21 – Clothing Recycler (Circular Economy Advocate)
Q: How much textile waste do you see from local businesses?​
A: A lot — especially from uniforms and promotional items that change seasonally.
Q: Could a company like Stormboy play a role in reducing that?​
A: Definitely. They could set up a take-back or repair system, or work with us to recycle leftover materials.

Q: What do you think about subscription models in fashion or uniforms?​
A: They’re the future. You keep ownership of materials and control their lifecycle — that’s circular
thinking.
Q: How hard is it for small businesses to join circular systems?​
A: It’s not easy, but partnerships make it possible. We love collaborating with creative, proactive
companies.
Q: What would you say to a student exploring these issues?​
A: Always think beyond the product — ask what happens before and after it’s used.
