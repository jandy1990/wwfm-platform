TIMS3311 - Reflection

This reflection will focus on my key learnings and personal growth I have experienced whilst
working on my own natural home fragrance start up. I initially assumed that people would love
the novel idea of a 100% natural diffuser made from a single eucalyptus tree. However through
interviews, rapid iterative testing and applying design and entrepreneurship frameworks my start
up and I have experienced change and growth. I will discuss the lessons I have learned, the
networks I have created and where I see this venture going in the future.


This experience has taught me that I am more of a physical hands on person. I think this also
translates to me ‘doing’ more than just thinking about doing. In the past I have spent months
thinking about a start up venture and going into planning or designing websites without taking
action. Whereas with Truesap, I do first and think or justify or reflect second. It is worth noting
that this mindset shift was influenced by one of my peers - Benoir. Chatting to Benoir and
hearing some of his stories left me with the confidence and desire to work at speed. I remember
Dr Russel Manfield telling us the basics of the Lean Start up is to “fail cheap, fail fast” which is
exactly what Benoir used to succeed. With this in mind, it made the process much easier
actually.
One key highlight was securing a partnership with a tree lopping company. After calling up and
speaking to the company I was able to solve one of the largest worries I had for scaling the
business. This small win gave me a huge confidence boost, now having access to more
materials that are sustainable and circular. These networks helped me to understand more
about real world entrepreneurship and how collaboration can accelerate growth.
The most difficult problem I had to face was the fact that I had to leave the 100% from one
eucalyptus tree dream behind and pivot. Unfortunately, after testing lots of prototypes of
eucalyptus wood for the diffuser reeds (whittled branches, uniformly cut sticks, different
thicknesses and diameters) they were just not as effective as the industry standard rattan reeds.
As I was faced with challenges along this journey, I always approached them with a positive
attitude. “Ok, can’t change what has happened, but what can I do now to solve it”. Always
looking to the future for a solution.
In hindsight I would start selling these sooner. Go to weekend markets, set up little stores and
start selling. There would be lots of conversations that would bring insights, and I would be able
to test the product with users, and make sales. Overall these lessons learnt taught me resilience
and adaptability which are essential qualities for navigating the uncertainty of entrepreneurship.


Before this experience, my entrepreneurial understanding was largely theoretical. As a design
student, a lot of my experience has been thinking about, exploring and developing solutions.
When it comes to start ups and this course, testing assumptions and getting feedback from user
interviews has been the most valuable part.
I believe that the design thinking frameworks I used, empathy mapping, system mapping and
problem interviews with users, were great at framing the problem. It helped with getting a strong
platform to stand on for me to see the real problem at hand from many perspectives (IDF, 2025).
However the most important and valuable entrepreneurial theory for me was the in person rapid
iterative testing and the build-measure-learn approach (Ries, 2011). These in person tests were
the most valuable as I was getting the raw responses from users, which helped in the iteration
process to make better suited products. In one of my initial tests, I had brought an early
prototype to someone in my target market. I was asked a question about the longevity of the
product which is something I needed to work on and got me thinking about how. I experimented
with tallow, yuki-sagi and raw linseed oil, all natural sealants that play into the brand image.
Each test was not perfect, but I learnt more about how to balance sustainability with
performance. Something else I learnt from these tests was that the longer I spent talking with
someone the deeper the insights got. Provoking questions and allowing people to go on
tangents and talk for an unset amount of time reveals things that would not come from a surface
level conversation. For example a 2 minute conversation, “Oh i like ocean breeze smells” vs a
15 minute “My cat once jumped up on top of my dresser and started smelling my perfumes”.
Although this isn't a very insightful example it shows the stark difference in what I could get out
of people for just spending more time talking with them.
At this time of the venture I had enough customer feedback and reached the pivot or persevere
stage. With the guidance from my course lecturer, it was time to persevere with the target
market of middle aged mothers aged 35-45. This was to help refine the attributes of the product
like scent, size and price. This process represented the switch from the exploration phase into
the refining and validation phase, something the lean start up approach endorses.


I would say that this course has metaphorically opened up doors that I wouldn't have opened
without it and also helped me grow in confidence. Through becoming more invested in the
entrepreneurial process and start ups, I have gained skills and now have a desire to learn more
and educate myself to become a better entrepreneur. This has led me to going to more events
hosted by UQ ventures, watch more videos of this kind of thing on youtube and have
conversations and reach out to people who have succeeded before. I think I will continue to
pursue entrepreneurship and go to these events and be involved in Brisbane's entrepreneurial
ecosystem because I believe I can do as these people have done before me and make a
difference.



I have definitely benefited from going to the events hosted by UQ Ventures and would
recommend that these events are exposed to all students doing this course. I would also
recommend more peer led sessions for feedback. The class we had where everyone had a
chance to share was massively helpful and we can learn a lot from our peers just through
conversation. Finally I would recommend more encouragement for guidance early in the
semester. I feel as though a compulsory check in the first week after we were given the
assignment would help everyone stay on track and ensure we are heading in the right direction.

Diary entries

I did my first interviews today, 8th september. I made sure to keep the questions open ended
like the suggestions I got in feedback for assignment 1. However because I had been so deep in
the research and design thinking realm, I just had the straight questions. This also is a learning
experience for how to conduct interviews, but I realised after these first interviews I needed to
introduce the topic before asking them questions about it. To establish a bit of context and a
common agreement on the topic so that the answers would be of high quality and more directly
relevant.

I was conducting another interview today with a very eco conscious mother, and she asked a
question focused around longevity of home fragrance products. And this got my thinking about
my initial concept of the 100% eucalyptus reed diffuser idea. I had already started prototyping
and to ensure longevity there would need to be some changes. My design thinking brain went to
work on the different types of wood sealants, how i could ensure the sticks dont go mouldy, and
all the little details. Upon reflecting I can see that in order to make a fully natural, sustainable
and ecofriendly product there would be a lot of work to do. Now i see why some larger
companies cut corners and and up greenwashing, because it is the easier option. I want to stay
true to the brand identity and cut no corners. Trust between a business and its customers is
more important that pumping out more products. I feel as though the brand identity of a niche
business like this is also extremely important especially when it will come to scaling the brand in
the future.

After that last entry and more interviews I experimented with different techniques of sealing the
timber. The reason why you seal the timber is so that it will last much longer. So after a bit of
research I tested my first method. Staying true to the 100% natural idea, beef tallow was used. I
thought since it’s used for lots of other natural methods, has some absorbing properties and
repels water it could work well. I melted it down and applied a couple layers. And after testing
this prototype with a sample group I realised I couldn't continue to use tallow in the future for a
couple reasons.1 it has a lingering smell that interferes with the eucalyptus and 2. It doesn't fully
repel the water in the oil pocket so some is lost and seeps into the base, and 3 it transfers onto
the reed sticks making them absorb less. I also tried another Japanese method of Yaki Sugi,
which chars the exterior layer of the timber to repel moisture, pests and rotting. This was quite
difficult though and the carbon char is hard to control. Thus, another option, linseed oil is being
tested on the prototypes. When I was at bunnings there were two types of linseed oil - boiled
and raw. Now, boiled linseed oil is quite popular for sealing timber, however I did some research
in the store to compare the two and found that although boiled linseed oil takes far less time to
cure, it does contain chemicals and VOC’s. Obviously I went with the raw oil, but now I have to
wait a couple of weeks to see if it is effective. My next option will be to just coat the inside of the
oil hole with bio epoxy resin. Yet again the importance of choosing the harder but right option
over the easy wrong option shows itself, much like the last entry.

I recently revisited my feedback notes for the first assignment and leaned into my effectuation
approach more. I started with mapping my unique advantages, and something that came from
this was the fact that I like to create and I feel more pride in something ive created myself vs
bought. Now paring this information with a push for more broader solution testing, with the
eucalyptus diffuser only being one of many tested MVP’s, I came up with some more possible
MVP’s to test. When you strip a diffuser back to the basics, it's just a carrier (something to put
the fragrance in), the fragrance, and some way to spread the fragrance. What if people could
create their own diffusers with a kit. What if my company supplied the oil and rattan reed sticks,
and there was a push for the customer to create their own carrier. Upcycle some glass jar or
bottle, or make your own. This is definitely something that will need to be tested with customers.

Today marks the day I have to give up the “made from a single tree” story. Unfortunately with the
majority of the people i have tested my prototypes with they say that the eucalyptus wood reed
sticks are just not effective. This marks a pivot. It is not a major pivot as the industry standard
rattan reed sticks are still 100% natural so that is still fine, but I feel as though a little piece of the
dream has faded. In hindsight this is actually a great discovery. Would I rather produce a less
effective product or a more effective product? In the lean start up methodology iterating based
off of user feedback is a major touchpoint and this kind of change should be celebrated.
