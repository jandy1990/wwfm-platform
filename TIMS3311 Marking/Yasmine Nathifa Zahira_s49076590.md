PART 1: CRITICAL REFLECTION ESSAY


 1.​   Introduction to the WIL
       I undergo the iLab/UQ Startup track with Sepal, a UQ startup that streamlines local
       market operations for organisers and stallholders. The objective is to address the cold
       start issue and validate stakeholder problems through qualitative interviews.


 2.​   Overall WIL Experience
       2.1.​     Personal Lessons
               2.1.1.​   New Things Learned
                         I recognised my capacity to stay adaptable in the new and unknown
                         circumstances. I get worried about the project’s progress when our first
                         reach to market organisers in Brisbane area got minimal responses. Sepal’s
                         traction plan focused on Brisbane large organisers. But after sending 15
                         emails and receiving only 3 replies, I proposed expanding our outreach
                         over Brisbane to go to other regions in QLD and later all over Australia.
                         So far, we contacted around 70 organisers across 5 outreach batches in
                         total and secured 13 interviews.


                         Our first positive response came from Bardon Markets. Not long after, we
                         get encouraged to do in-person visits to secure interview quotas. We then
                         met the organiser of Jan Powers Farmers Market, which became our first
                         on-site interview. Invaluable to see their booking system and market map
                         firsthand. During this visit, we also interviewed stallholders. In the
                         following weeks we continued stallholder visits at The Collective Markets,
                         West End Markets, and Mt Gravatt Markets.


               2.1.2.​   Highlights and Difficult Times
                         When most organisers didn’t respond, I’d say that was the most difficult
                         stage, regardless of the effort we put into researching websites and social
                         medias. Discouraging to see our cold emails get minimal responses, which


                                                                                                  1
          made us question whether our reach out was effective. We also had no
          opportunity for warm introductions. However, this challenge became one
          of the most valuable learning points as it taught us to stay adept instead of
          following an unvarying plan. Breakthrough was when we finally hearing
          back from interviewees.


          Another highlight was leading the team. I sometimes struggled to keep
          everything on track. Often I had to multitask coordinating meetings,
          updating our tracker, along with communicating internally. I committed to
          keep documenting progress and updating the tracker so everyone stayed
          accountable, though at times I felt doing things alone. The routine helped
          the team stay organised and maintain consistent progress.


2.1.3.​   Dealt with Challenges
          Effectuation’s frameworks were applied to tackle the challenges.
          Bird-in-Hand helped me use the resources already available, which are our
          team and online information, while building structure early through an
          outreach tracker and regular check-ins. Lemonade helped me see low
          response rates as feedback and use them to restructure our approach. I
          seek advice and visited markets directly to secure the quota when
          cold-emails were less effective. Effectuation prompt me that leadership
          under uncertainty is about staying resourceful and learning as you go.


2.1.4.​   Things Do Differently in Hindsight
          Instead of waiting for difficulties to come, I’d say I’ll make a contingency
          plan of what event we're going to come by, that may or may not happen in
          the future. Later on the journey, I found tools such as Lucidchart’s
          planning charts could help visualise alternative scenarios. I also found out
          the Business Model Environmental Map (2019) by Strategyzer could
          further help understand the context within the market operation space,
          which could help a lot with mapping. Specifically to the market reachout,


                                                                                     2
                        I’ll also prepare alternative channels such as Facebook or LinkedIn,
                        alongside email. Lastly, I’d share outreach responsibilities more evenly
                        within the team to avoid bottlenecks and fatigue.


      2.2.​     Networks Established
              2.2.1.​   Specific Networks Built
                        Through this WIL, I built networks within both the Sepal ecosystem and
                        the Australian market community. Direct connections were from the
                        organisers we contacted all over Australian states, along with stallholders
                        from the markets we reached out to. In addition, I collaborate with my
                        teammates Linh and Chang (Hannah) and Sepal's team, Kanish and
                        Vikram.


              2.2.2.​   Value Derived Beyond Surface-Level Benefits
                        The relationships with organisers gave me awareness of the market
                        culture. Understanding some organisers’ dilemma to accept new digital
                        systems taught me that innovation must line up with human needs, not just
                        the sake of efficient systems. The experience also improved my personal
                        development. I learned how to build outreach emails (and rejections) and
                        empathise more with customer pains and gains using the valuable
                        resources introduced in the degree so far. I also valued the teamwork built
                        throughout the WIL journey, specifically through challenges.


3.​   New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills
      3.1.​     The Past
                My knowledge of entrepreneurship was limited to conventional business
                functions. Growing up in a family-run retail SME, I understood supply and
                demand along with the marketing side but not how innovation have value along
                the way.




                                                                                                 3
          Joining UQ gave me theoretical frameworks and a bigger view of
          entrepreneurship, but had not applied them beyond class exercises. That’s why I
          was look forward to join TIMS3311, as the WIL gave me an opportunity to put
          into practice what previously only learned in theory, in an Australian startup
          setup.


3.2.​     Key Learnings
        3.2.1.​    Design Thinking
                   Design Thinking taught us how to approach stakeholder engagement with
                   empathy and structure and become the most important framework in our
                   problem validation. Stanford’s Design School (2010) defines empathy as
                   the “centerpiece of a human-centered design process,” helping uncover
                   users’ needs through observation and engagement. While Sepal at first
                   seemed focused on efficiency, I soon realised that understanding
                   organisers’ frustrations need a more empathetic view.


                   Using Maurya’s (2017) Problem Interview Script, I used Design Thinking
                   to craft empathetic interview questions. Guided by “How Might We”
                   questions, I reframed each of Sepal’s four pain points (which already
                   researched before), which are Bookings and Payments, Product
                   Uniqueness, Compliance Tracking, and Cancellations, into exploratory
                   questions. I asked them to walk me through their current workflow and
                   describe which steps felt most time-consuming or stressful instead of
                   directly asking whether organisers faced difficulties. This approach gave
                   more open and honest responses.


                   We also used journey mapping to envisage stakeholders’ pain points
                   throughout the market application operation. I found a visual tool that
                   helped our team find out where delays happened and gave structure to
                   what would otherwise be teh feedback. I also completed the BCG X -
                   Venture & Business Builds virtual internship this semester, which gave me


                                                                                          4
          a clearer understanding of how journey mapping connects to capturing
          value across the venture-building process.


          Design Thinking acts as the foundation of our iLab/UQ startup placement
          as it helps us approach research as a conversation built on empathy rather
          than just a data-gathering task.


3.2.2.​   Lean Startup
          Blank    (2013)     emphasises     that   successful   ventures   prioritise
          experimentation and customer feedback over elaborate planning. It guided
          our premature problem-validation, where we focused on confirming
          whether the problem existed before giving solutions, as in Lean Startup
          guidance.


          Led by Blank (2013) and Osterwalder’s Value Proposition Design (2014),
          I treated our first interview as an MVP. Each interview became a test
          within the build-measure-learn loop, helping validate assumptions step by
          step. I added follow-up questions such as how long email exchanges or
          approvals took before stallholders secured a position after I observed some
          patterns on the answers.


          Strategyzer’s (2025) VPC further clarified how organisers’ pains and gains
          aligned with our proposed features. This process moved my mindset from
          predicting outcomes to learning through quick feedback loops. I’ve come
          to see this iterative way of thinking as something important for my future
          roles.


3.2.3.​   Effectuation
          While Design Thinking and Lean Startup directed how I approached the
          WIL, Effectuation shaped how I approached myself throughout it. It
          became my most personal transformative framework because it reflected


                                                                                    5
                  how myself truly function amidst the uncertainty. Sarasvathy’s logic line
                  up closely with my experience at Sepal, where responses were
                  unpredictable and progress depended on what we could control. I applied
                  the Lemonade by turning setbacks into opportunities when I see the cold
                  email responses were low. We widened our outreach beyond Brisbane and
                  treated each rejection as feedback. I chose to make due with what we
                  already had rather than waiting for the perfect situation with Bird-in-hand.


                  Effectuation also influenced how I led the team. As the designated lead, I
                  found that leadership is more about empowering others to take action than
                  it is about having power. I recorded milestones, maintained the team
                  tracker and acted as a liaison to Sepal’s team to keep progress structured
                  and transparent. I came to see leadership through Effectuation, which is
                  building structure out of uncertainty and turning limited resources into
                  progress.


3.3.​     The Future
        3.3.1.​   Current and/or Future Career
                  The WIL experience boosted my ability to use evidence-based validation
                  and human-centred research, which are directly applicable to future roles
                  in consulting, business analysis, or venture creation. The iterative and
                  empathetic approach I practised at Sepal hopefully will guide how I design
                  and test new ideas in any future organisation I’m pursuing.


        3.3.2.​   Career Trajectory Impact
                  As a Business-Management student, a field that was quite general, I’m not
                  sure which pathway I’m going to take. The WIL experience clear up my
                  career direction. Experiencing the startup work gave me confidence to
                  pursue human-centred innovation and consider careers that blend strategy
                  and design, such as venture studios or social enterprises. I am also keen on
                  working in an adaptive, learning-oriented environment.


                                                                                             6
3.4.​     Course Feedback
        3.4.1.​   Value Identification
                  I valued how the TIMS3311 course gave me a real-world application of
                  my major. Working directly with a growing startup venture gave me depth
                  that both traditional courses or regular internship can’t give. I also
                  appreciate the opportunity to see a startup’s growth hands-on.


        3.4.2.​   Potential Improvements
                     1.​ I think mandatory check-ins could help students stay on
                         trackduring this flexible course, though announcements and
                         consultations were given. I think it could be made through weekly
                         diary entries or required consultations.
                     2.​ I noticed on 13 October in-class check-ins, other students received
                         help from other cohorts on their project. A group discussion
                         channel with facilitators could help future cohorts connect and
                         share solutions more easily.
                     3.​ Lastly, a specific individual scoring system would make grading
                         fairer. A Google Docs template combining quantitative and written
                         feedback could better capture each member’s contribution than
                         current tools like BuddyCheck as this project was quite heavy
                         unlike regular assignments.

PART 2: REFLECTIVE DIARIES


Entry 1
Timeline: 28 August - 13 October 2025


I began blasting out cold emails to the organiser, between 8-10 September. After waiting for a
week, I realised that only 2 out of 10 Brisbane organisers replied to our outreach and I worried
our project might be stuck. I then came up with a plan to expand our scope. First expanding
further into QLD (second batch), then into NSW and VIC (third batch), and finally, once I felt
we could secure the quota, into TAS and WA (fourth batch). The fifth batch I sent was on 13
October, just because some of the organisers ghosted us after saying their availability.


It required hours of research into markets across states, lurking into blogs and social media. In
Google Sheets, I created a master tracker that contained our timeline, milestones, market
locations, and other miscellaneous things. This tracker became a basis on our placement as it
kept the team on track and easier to communicate. It also becomes an accountable tool if
something occurs.


I learned to adapt from this experience. By pivoting early, I realised how impostant it is to plan
for multiple outcomes instead of relying on solely one pathway. The low response rate became
the encouragement for widening our scope, which made our validation more diversified and
representative of Australian markets rather than only focusing on Brisbane, as the initial traction.


Reflecting on this moment, I see it as an illustration of effectuation’s “Lemonade Principle”, in
which turning unexpected challenges into opportunities, and staying flexible! It also helped me
recognise adaptability under pressure as one of my growing traits..




Entry 2
Timeline 2: 13 September - 20 September 2025




                                                                                                   9
Our interview with Jan Powers marked a turning point in how we diversified validation. Up until
then, I had relied heavily on cold emails which generated little engagement. On 13 September, I
sent the second batch of cold emails, and (again) only two out of ten responses. We finally had a
catch-up with Jack on 15 September, where he suggested we go directly to the markets. I
coordinated for us to visit in person, targeting to meet organisers (or even marquees) and
interview stallholders as well. Based on our location, we decided to visit two markets over the
weekend (20-21 September), which are Jan Powers Farmers Market and The Collective Markets.
The following week, we also went to West End Markets and Mt Gravatt Markets, for
interviewing stallholders.


Though the organiser stall wasn’t available for The Collective Market, we did meet Astrid, the
coordinator of the Jan Powers Farmers Market. I was nervous, but seeing how open she was in
person made me realise that direct, go-to-market approaches were effective. To our surprise, our
email hadn’t even been read and was buried in a pile of approx. 100 emails! We then get a lot of
information from the interview, and she even showed us their current system for sorting
stallholders and their tent mapping.

Kanish (Sepal’s CEO) led us to understand the current problems in market operations during our
first meeting on 20 August. I already understand the main points, but I appreciated that he later
break down the problems according to key stakeholders, which are organisers, stallholders and
customers.

On 12 September, we had a progress catch-up where he explained the four main pain points
faced by organisers, which he had identified through conversations with them: Bookings and
Payments; Product Uniqueness and Category Saturation; Compliance Tracking; and
Cancellations. Then, we about to interview stallholders, we had another quick catch-up (17
September) about stallholders' pain point, which is Brand Activation. I changed the format of our
qualitative interview questions to emphasise empathy-driven prompts in response to feedback.

This process showed me how to translate theory into practice. Design Thinking’s empathise
mode (2010) moved from being an abstract concept to something that shaped how we made our
scripts. Instead of asking superficial questions, I test assumptions methodically using Ash
Maurya's Problem Interview framework (2017). We were able to better understand stallholders'
frustrations with their gains and pains by using Lean Startup's Value Proposition Design (VPC),
which is based on Oswalder's Value Proposition Design (2014). The “Humble Discovery”
Google Drive definitely gave us a lot of perspectives on customer development.

Why this matters is that it taught me the discipline of listening and researching deeper.
Entrepreneurs often jump straight to solutions, but I learned that framing questions around lived
experiences open more real-life needs. This enhanced our validation and gave us with assurance
that we understood the definition of our problem.




Entry 4
Timeline: 13 September - Present

Learning how to talk to stakeholders from diverse backgrounds is one of the most memorable
lessons from this WIL. It was far from perfect when it first started. My first call is with Mitch
from Bardon Markets by a phone call (13 September). I had to restate and clarify my questions
because I stammered a lot. I've finally gained confidence in interviews after doing a number of
them.

I mentioned that if Sepal’s product wasn’t ready, we could position ourselves as student
researchers rather than company representatives in the Assignment 1 presentation. This framing
helped me get traction. I observed some hesitation when I went to interview Jan Powers until I
explained that we were UQ student researchers. Some organisers wrote in emails that they were
glad students had an eye in the industry.

“How Might We” (HMW) questions helped me to frame issues more constructive. While
responses openness differ across markets, positioning the project as a research initiative rather
than a sales call consistently reduced barriers and led to more honest conversations.

Timeline: Present

I took on the responsibility of spearheading this WIL overall journey. From my previous
experiences, I learned that accountability is the most important thing in any project, which means
I need to document everything. Hence why I created a tracker and a dedicated drive to keep our
milestones organised. I also update every milestone and record every meeting on a MoM. I also
took on the role of liaison between Sepal's and our team. We did have a Slack group, however I
frequently had to remind the team to stay on course or restate assigned tasks.

What surprised me was how much I ended up enjoying the role. I’d always seen myself as
someone more comfortable supporting from the side, yet in this WIL I proudly took pride in
leading.

WIL helped me see leadership as one of my growing traits. I’m still learning, especially with
delegating tasks and communication, but I realised that leadership is not only about assigning
responsibilities, but about creating a situation where uncertainty can be managed. I adopted
Effectuation's "Start with what you have, build as you go" mindset as I use the tools and people I
have in hand to keep things moving.
