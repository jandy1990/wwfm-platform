Personal Development Reflective Statement – TIMS3311 WIL Eclipse
Ingredients

By Kayden Canty (s48742348)

**The Overall Experience**

Over the past couple of months my work integrated learning experience
with Eclipse Ingredients has been a transformative and exhausting one. I
was a part of group of 5 helping eclipse shape their funding strategy,
with a focus on identifying potential investors for a series A round. My
role within the group covered all corners of the project, from
researching and mapping investors, drafting sections of the playbook,
and interviewing related people who can give insights on this area. Most
of the tasks done were very repetitive and time consuming and doing them
forced new habits of persistence, professional communication, and
analytical thinking. The early stages of the project were very
challenging. The number of hours spent scrolling through investor
websites, finding their values, and then seeing if it aligns with
eclipse was and absolute nightmare. We mainly focused on Europe and Asia
as Siobhan tole us to not bother with the United States. As developing
the excel sheet and list took a lot longer that I though it would,
really tested my patience and attention to detail. Doing this repetitive
task made me slowly realise how much discipline and structure is needed
to start a funded start-up as each data point mattered as a single wrong
assumption about an investor could waste time.

There were plenty of moments when I felt demotivated as the research, we
were all doing didn’t seem to lead anywhere. But because of this I
started to appreciate how this essential groundwork forms the foundation
for entrepreneurial success. I became more self-aware of how I handle
uncertainty and repetitive tasks. By doing these tasks I discovered that
I prefer strategic syntheses over just raw data collection but also the
persistence in the “boring” part is essential for the meaningful
outcomes. One of the key highlights of the experience came from
converting the data we found into actual insights like the European
playbook. The process allowed me to see that innovation isn’t just
creativity but it’s about disciplined learning and how teamwork plays a
major factor with large tasks. If I was to do this again first, I
would’ve approached it differently. I would’ve set clear tasks to
complete from the beginning and more team meetings and not just talking
in Monday class or the call with Siobhan as communicating is the most
effective tool and is more important than the researching aspect.

**Networks and Relationships**

Throughout the WIL experience I was able to build some valuable
networks, within the broader entrepreneurial community and people in the
UQ Space. Firstly, within the team itself I learnt the importance of
communication by expressing expectations clearly, and us recognising
each other strengths each member brings to the table. Early on each of
us didn’t truly understand what an investor was and how there are
different types such as a ‘Lead Investor’ which obviously created a new
learning curve of understanding and terminology. Once we got past these
obstacles the learning and research aspect became slightly easier.

However, outside the group I had multiple chances to engage with other
Entrepreneurs and learn from them about their struggles. One of the
events I attended was at The Precinct early in the Semester where
Siobhan spoke about Eclipse. This event in of itself changed my
perspective on entrepreneurship as speaking with other founders opened
to the harsh reality of the amount of effort, time, and risk that is
needed within the start-up world. I never realised how strategic and
calculated you need to be when venturing in the start-up world and how
recognising patterns and opportunities are vital. The direct exposure
into this environment showed me how supportive and connected everyone
is. It is no doubt that the Entrepreneurial ecosystem within Australia
is very supportive and inviting. Having the ability to hear everyone
else’s personal stories and their struggles is always more valuable than
any research. One key figure that was very open to me was Sam Bricknell
(CEO TECHVISA) of who was very supportive and backed me for any possible
visions I told him about. Having these connections will ultimately
change how I look forward as entrepreneurship isn’t just about building
a product it’s about building relationships as well.

**New Knowledge, Insights, and Practice Skills**

**Prior Knowledge**

As mentioned earlier before starting this WIL project my understanding
of entrepreneurship was mostly theoretical. As through previous courses
I understood about business models, lean start-up principles, and
funding rounds but I had no idea what they looked in practice. That
stood as a major reason why I picked the series A start-up funding
project to begin with. My skills were essentially useless as I could
only describe the practice and concepts but not actually apply them in a
professional setting. This made me underestimated how structured and
data driven start-ups really are.

**New Concepts, Theories, and Skills**

Within this project I was able to transition theory into practice. One
of the major concepts that stood out was effectuation. This focuses on
working with the means you have instead of chasing ideal conditions.
This became very apparent during the investor mapping process as we
couldn’t wait for perfect data but instead made reasoned assumptions
refined through research and tried to adapt as new information came in
or if Siobhan pointed us in a different direction. Another learning
curve was investor alignment. One of the key tasks set to us was finding
a possible ‘Lead investor’. As lead investors hold a lot of power within
the company its essential to make sure their values and morals align
with Siobhan’s and her vision. With this in mind I learned to assess
investor profiles not just by cheque size or geography, but by thematic
interest and portfolio logic. Having this new skill at my disposal have
allowed for new appreciation for strategy work and the nuances of
stakeholder matching.

Another major skill I have acquired is turning large data sets into
strategy documents. As we all created a Funding Strategy Playbook
focusing on the European sector as that’s where Siobhan is traveling to.
The playbook requires for hundreds of potential investors data points
into actionable insights. This includes, their values, what they have
invested in before, and what events they might be attending for you to
go to. this helped me develop stronger research synthesis and
professional writing skills. The process also taught me to think in
systems that connect market trends, investor psychology, and company
positioning into a coherent story. The Lean Start-up framework was
another aspect of this project. By witnessing how VC’s prioritise market
validation and tangible progress made me realise testing assumptions
early is vital. This shattered my belief that great ideas alone attract
funding but in reality, investors want proof of traction, credibility,
and governance all elements that show execution not imagination. One
major thing I had to overcome was the massive time constraints I had
with this project. This entire semester I have been under constant
pressure and have been forced to manage my time effectively. This is so
as I work two jobs, still do three other courses, and still have my
professional squash career that I have to mange while participating in
this project. I would say that is one of the biggest skills I’ve taken
away as it wasn’t voluntarily but a necessity.

The Future

This WIL experience really has changed my perspective. Before eclipse I
was curious about start-ups but was always unsure if I could ever see
myself working within one. But now after being in that environment I
have a more grounded view that entrepreneurship involves long hours,
uncertain rewards and consistent learning. By being in the experience
I’ve been more inclined towards ‘boot strapping’ entrepreneurship rather
than pursing external funding, at least for any first ventures I go for.
I firsthand saw how much time and effort was needed for fundraising and
how it can distract from a product and customer development standpoint.
If I was to pursue my own business, I would rather prefer to maintain
control and grow more organically before involving investors. At the
same time, I developed a stronger interest in **strategy and finance**,
particularly in how funding decisions shape business growth. This could
steer me toward roles in venture consulting, financial strategy, or
innovation management. I now see financial literacy as an essential
skill for future leaders, and I plan to invest time in learning more
about startup finance, valuation, and capital structuring.

Value of the WIL Program and Suggestions for Improvement

What I liked the most about the WIL experience was its realism. Unlike
theorical coursework this project instead placed us within an
environment where ambiguity was normal, and initiative mattered. It
forced me to balance autonomy with collaboration, and to appreciate how
much unseen effort goes into building something new.

Here are ways the program can be improved.

1.  Clearer role definitions and milestones from the beginning

Early in the project the whole team struggled to understand what was
expected and how, like the investor spreadsheet and the playbook. This
was especially relevant as when we finally gave Siobhan her spreadsheet,
she already had one her employees create one kind of making our
irrelevant.

2.  When Assignments are due

This one is more of a personal suggestion. I would’ve preferred if the
last two assignment were a bit further apart rather than all jumbled up
at the end of the semester. I understand you cannot have a full
reflection until the end of the project but have two from this course
plus four others from other courses does add up a lot.

Overall, I found TIMS3311 very enjoyable and valuable. As it didn’t only
teach me about innovation and entrepreneurship but also about myself. I
learned first-hand how to manage time and stay consistent and how
effectively I can work within a team.

**Journal Entries**

Entry 1 – Early research

Within the first couple of weeks working with Eclipse was the hardest.
As our main role was researching potential investors across Europe and
Asia to build a spreadsheet detailing all the aspects of each possible
investor. This rabbit hole took hours upon hours of finding someone 🡪
seeing their past investments 🡪 getting a grasp on their standings 🡪
seeing if they align with Siobhan’s vision. This was the consistent
pattern feeling repetitive and pointless. Honestly it was all about
finding a flow to follow and I slowly starting to develop a technique to
how I approach to finding information. This task is teaching me patience
and structure importance.

Entry 2

After consistent weeks of collecting data on possible investors our
group moved to analysing Eclipse’s competitors and who is funding them.
This was more engaging than the research slop that we have been doing
for ages as it started to connect the data all together. This allowed us
to identify patterns and recognise the type of investors who lead early
and who prefer to follow on later. The idea of effectuation was applied
here as we were working with the information, we had rather than getting
the perfect amount needed especially since Siobhan indirectly told us to
get our skates on, so we had to move on.
