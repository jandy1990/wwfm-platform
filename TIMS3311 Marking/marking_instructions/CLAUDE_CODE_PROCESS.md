## SETUP

1. Read these files in order:
   - `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (overview)
   - `MARKING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (detailed guidance)
   - `MARKING_WORKSHEET.md` (template to follow)

2. For each submission, work through systematically

## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: Initial Assessment
- Extract student name and ID
- Count words (essay and diary entries separately)
- Identify WIL pathway (iLab/Own Venture/Corporate) if mentioned
- Count diary entries
- Flag any format issues

### STEP 2: Theory Identification (CRITICAL)
Scan entire essay for entrepreneurial frameworks:

**Design Thinking indicators:**
- Words: empathy, empathy map/mapping, prototype, ideate, journey map, HMW (How Might We), user-centered, human-centered, define, test
- Concepts: Understanding users, iterative testing, co-creation
- Names: Brown, Liedtka, IDEO

**Lean Startup indicators:**
- Words: Build-Measure-Learn, MVP (Minimum Viable Product), hypothesis, validate/validation, pivot, persevere, customer development, problem interviews, solution interviews, BMC (Business Model Canvas), Value Proposition Canvas, validated learning
- Concepts: Testing assumptions, rapid experimentation, pivoting
- Names: Ries, Blank

**Effectuation indicators:**
- Words: bird-in-hand, affordable loss, crazy quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-plane, means inventory
- Phrases: "who I am, what I know, whom I know", "start with what you have", "leverage surprises"
- Concepts: Working with available resources, forming partnerships, embracing contingency
- Names: Sarasvathy

**Record:**
- Which frameworks are explicitly discussed
- Quality of discussion (deep vs superficial)
- Specific examples provided
- Citations present

### STEP 3: Mark Each Section

Work through rubric systematically:

**Section A: Overall WIL Experience (8 marks)**
- Personal lessons (5): Look for self-awareness, highlights + difficulties, how dealt with challenges, hindsight
- Networks (3): Look for specific networks named, value derived beyond "I met people"

**Section B: New Knowledge (16 marks)**
- The Past (3): Prior knowledge baseline
- **Key learnings (9): Use theory identification from Step 2**
  - 3 frameworks well = 8-9/9
  - 2 frameworks well = 7-8/9
  - 1 framework well = max 6/9
  - No frameworks = max 4/9
- The Future (4): Career impact, changed thinking
- Course feedback (3): What valued + count suggestions (need 3)

**Section C: Diary Entries (3 marks)**
- Count entries (need 5+)
- Assess quality: Reflective vs descriptive, specific vs generic, shows growth
- 3 marks = 5+ excellent entries
- 2 marks = 5+ average entries
- 1 mark = <5 entries OR poor quality

### STEP 4: Calculate Total
- Add all section marks
- Convert to percentage
- Assign grade per boundaries
- Verify math

### STEP 5: Write Feedback

**Paragraph 1 - Strengths (4-5 sentences)**
- Start: "[Name], this was [excellent/strong work/good initiative]..."
- Highlight 2-3 main strengths with specifics
- Mention evidence (interview counts, specific frameworks used, etc.)
- Keep professional tone (2.5/5 enthusiasm)

**Paragraph 2 - Improvement (3-5 sentences)**
- For D/C/P grades: Start with "To have achieved a higher grade..."
- Be specific about what was missing
- Point to concrete improvements (e.g., "explicitly discussing Effectuation principles")
- For HD: Can note minor improvements OR confirm excellence

**Paragraph 3 - Encouragement (2-3 sentences)**
- Forward-looking
- Connect to career/future
- Brief and professional

### STEP 6: Quality Check
- [ ] All rubric sections marked
- [ ] Total adds correctly
- [ ] Theory discussion properly assessed
- [ ] Feedback has 3 paragraphs with NO labels
- [ ] Student name used in feedback
- [ ] Tone is professional (2.5/5 enthusiasm)
- [ ] Specific examples from their work cited
- [ ] For D/C: "To have achieved higher grade..." included

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Don't miss implicit framework discussion** - If they describe the concept well without using the exact term, still give credit
2. **Don't be too harsh on theory** - Some demonstration is better than none
3. **Don't ignore word count** - Flag if significantly over/under (25%)
4. **Don't forget diary quality** - Count AND quality matter
5. **Don't use labels in feedback** - Just three unlabeled paragraphs
6. **Don't be effusive** - Professional, not gushing (2.5/5 enthusiasm)
7. **Don't forget student names** - Always start feedback with name
