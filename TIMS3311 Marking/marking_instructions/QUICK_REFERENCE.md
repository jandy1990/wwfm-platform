## THEORY IDENTIFICATION (CRITICAL FOR KEY LEARNINGS)

### Design Thinking
**Look for:** empathy (mapping), prototype, ideate, journey map, HMW, user-centered, define, test

### Lean Startup  
**Look for:** Build-Measure-Learn, MVP, hypothesis, validate, pivot, persevere, customer development, interviews, Business Model Canvas

### Effectuation
**Look for:** bird-in-hand, affordable loss, crazy quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-plane, means inventory (who I am, what I know, whom I know)

**Scoring Key Learnings (9 marks):**
- NO frameworks = max 4/9
- 1 framework well = max 6/9
- 2 frameworks well = 7-8/9
- 3 frameworks well = 8-9/9

## FEEDBACK STRUCTURE

**3 paragraphs, NO LABELS:**

1. **Strengths** - Start with "[Name], this was excellent/strong work/good initiative..." + specific strengths
2. **Improvement** - For D/C: "To have achieved higher grade..." + specific gaps. For HD: Confirm excellence.
3. **Encouragement** - Forward-looking, career focus, brief

**Tone: 2.5/5 enthusiasm (professional, not effusive)**

## QUICK DECISION TREE

**Is essay 1000-1500 words?**
- Yes → Continue
- No (flag if <750 or >1875) → Note in feedback

**Are 5+ diary entries present?**
- Yes → 2-3 marks based on quality
- No → Max 1 mark

**Do they discuss entrepreneurial frameworks?**
- All 3 well → 8-9/9 for Key Learnings
- 2 well → 7-8/9
- 1 well → Max 6/9
- None → Max 4/9

**Overall quality?**
- Sophisticated theory + extensive evidence + profound reflection → HD (26-30)
- Solid theory + good evidence + decent reflection → D (23-25)
- Basic theory + adequate evidence + some reflection → C (20-22)
- Weak theory + limited evidence → P or F

## RED FLAGS

- Missing rubric section → 0 marks for that section
- No theory discussion → Max 4/9 Key Learnings
- Fewer than 5 diary entries → Max 1/3 Diary
- Wrong format entirely → Flag for instructor

## CALIBRATION ANCHORS

**HD example:** 17 interviews, all 3 frameworks with citations, profound self-reflection, 30/30

**D example:** 70 surveys + 30 interviews, 2 frameworks explicit (Lean strong, DT mentioned, Effectuation not named), good leadership discussion, 26.5/30

**C example:** Some interviews, mentions Lean & Effectuation but limited depth, no Design Thinking, under word count, 22/30
