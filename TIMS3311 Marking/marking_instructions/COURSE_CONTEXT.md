# TIMS3311 Course Context

## What is TIMS3311?

**TIMS3311: Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Practice** is a Work Integrated Learning (WIL) course where undergraduate students apply innovation/entrepreneurship frameworks to real-world startup and venture contexts.

## Three WIL Pathways

Students work in one of three pathways:

1. **iLab/UQ Startup Consulting (~70% of students)**
   - Partner with early-stage startups through UQ's iLab program
   - Apply frameworks to solve real business challenges
   - Create value for partner organizations

2. **Own Venture (~20% of students)**
   - Develop their own business idea
   - Apply frameworks to their own entrepreneurial journey
   - Build actual MVPs and test with real customers

3. **Corporate Innovation Placement (~10% of students)**
   - Work with established companies on innovation initiatives
   - Apply frameworks to internal innovation processes
   - Navigate organizational culture and change management

## Core Academic Content: Innovation Frameworks

The primary academic content is the application of three innovation/entrepreneurship frameworks:

### 1. Design Thinking
- Empathy mapping
- Customer journey mapping
- How Might We (HMW) questions
- Rapid prototyping and testing
- Human-centered problem solving

### 2. Lean Startup
- Build-Measure-Learn cycles
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Customer development
- Problem/solution interviews
- Pivot or persevere decisions
- Business Model Canvas

### 3. Effectuation
- Bird-in-hand principle (start with means)
- Affordable loss
- Crazy quilt (partnerships and commitments)
- Lemonade principle (leverage surprises)
- Pilot-in-the-plane (control vs. predict)

## Why Theory Integration Matters

**Theory integration is weighted heavily (9/30 marks) because:**

- These frameworks are the core academic learning objectives
- Students must demonstrate understanding beyond surface-level knowledge
- The course emphasizes theory-practice bridge: applying academic concepts to real contexts
- Professional employers value graduates who can apply structured methodologies
- Integration shows critical thinking and practical application skills

## Assessment Sequence

1. **Assessment 1:** Project Proposal Presentation (August)
   - Students propose their WIL project
   - Identify problem and methodology
   - Present to class for feedback

2. **Assessment 2:** Reflective Diary & Critical Reflection (October) ← **YOU ARE MARKING THIS**
   - Students reflect on their WIL experience
   - Demonstrate learning and theory application
   - Show professional growth

3. **Assessment 3:** Final Report/Business Case (November)
   - Deliverable for partner organization
   - Evidence-based recommendations
   - Academic rigor with practical value

## What Success Looks Like

**High-performing students:**
- Explicitly name frameworks (not just describe concepts)
- Show genuine application with specific examples from their WIL
- Demonstrate learning evolution from novice to practitioner
- Connect theory to real outcomes and decisions
- Reflect critically on what worked and what didn't

**Average students:**
- Mention frameworks but with less depth
- Provide examples but less specific connection
- Show learning but less evidence of integration
- Generic reflection without deep theory engagement

## Marking Philosophy

- **Most students should receive Distinction (23-25/30)**
- These are undergraduate students learning to apply theory for the first time
- Look for genuine effort to integrate frameworks, not perfection
- Value honest reflection about struggles as much as successes
- Specific examples matter more than abstract discussion

**Key Takeaway for Marking:**

When a student explicitly discusses Design Thinking, Lean Startup, or Effectuation with specific examples from their WIL experience, reward this generously. This is the core evidence of learning we're assessing.
