## THEORY IDENTIFICATION GUIDE

Students MUST explicitly discuss entrepreneurial frameworks. Look for:

### Design Thinking
**Keywords:** empathy, empathy mapping, define, ideate, prototype, test, user-centered, journey mapping, HMW (How Might We), Crazy 8s

**What it looks like:**
- "Used empathy mapping to understand customer pain points"
- "Conducted journey mapping to see user experience"
- "Prototyped quickly to get feedback"
- "Design Thinking's empathy stage helped me..."

### Lean Startup
**Keywords:** Build-Measure-Learn, MVP, hypothesis, validate/validation, pivot, persevere, customer development, problem interviews, solution interviews, Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, validated learning

**What it looks like:**
- "Used Build-Measure-Learn cycle to..."
- "Created MVP to test assumptions"
- "Conducted 20 problem interviews to validate..."
- "Pivoted based on customer feedback"
- "Ries's Lean Startup framework..."

### Effectuation
**Keywords:** Bird-in-hand, affordable loss, crazy quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane, means inventory (who I am, what I know, whom I know), effectual asks

**What it looks like:**
- "Used bird-in-hand principle by starting with existing resources"
- "Calculated affordable loss before..."
- "Built crazy quilt through stakeholder commitments"
- "Applied lemonade principle when unexpected..."
- "Sarasvathy's effectuation theory..."

**IMPORTANT:** Students may demonstrate these concepts without using exact terminology. If they describe the process clearly (e.g., "I started by inventorying what resources I had"), give credit even without the label "bird-in-hand."

## CALIBRATED EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1: High Distinction (30/30)

**Student Profile:** Own venture (Vayla), 17 interviews, all frameworks with citations, profound reflection

**Key Learnings Extract:**
"Design Thinking reshaped how I understand empathy—not as a soft skill but as a structured method for uncovering consumer insight. Liedtka and Ogilvie describe empathy as 'seeing the world through your customer's eyes.' Using empathy mapping, our team analyzed what participants said, did, thought, and felt... The Lean Startup methodology (Ries, 2011) introduced a disciplined way to validate what we observed... Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001) reframed how I think about uncertainty."

**Why 9/9:** Sophisticated integration of frameworks with proper citations (Brown, Ries, Sarasvathy), highly specific application examples (17 interviews, empathy mapping, validation board), demonstrates deep theory-practice understanding, clear career transformation

**Feedback (173 words):**
Lily, this is excellent work. Your integration of Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Effectuation with proper academic citations (Brown, Ries, Sarasvathy) demonstrates sophisticated understanding. The 17 interviews across diverse stakeholders and progression from empathy mapping to concept testing shows genuine theory-practice application. Your honest reflection on over-preparation hindering experimentation is particularly insightful.

This work fully addresses all rubric criteria. The validation board, thematic coding, and discussion of how negative feedback became "evidence to iterate" demonstrate transformative learning.

Your shift from seeking precision to embracing disciplined curiosity represents meaningful growth. The skills you've developed will be valuable in strategy or innovation roles.

### EXAMPLE 2: High Distinction (28/30)

**Student Profile:** iLab startup, deep Lean Startup integration, mentions Design Thinking practically, doesn't explicitly name Effectuation

**Key Learnings Extract:**
"The Build-Measure-Learn cycle fundamentally changed how I approach problem-solving. Rather than perfecting solutions before testing, we ran rapid experiments. Our first 'concierge MVP'—manually fulfilling orders to test demand—taught us more in one week than months of planning would have. When customer feedback contradicted our assumptions, we pivoted our value proposition entirely. This validated learning approach, as Ries describes, transforms uncertainty from paralysis into progress."

**Why 9/9:** Exceptionally deep integration of Lean Startup with sophisticated understanding, specific examples showing genuine application, strong theory-practice bridge. Quality of integration compensates for not discussing all three frameworks explicitly.

**Feedback:**
This is excellent work demonstrating sophisticated understanding of entrepreneurial methodology. Your integration of Lean Startup is exceptional—the progression from hypothesis formation through concierge MVP to pivot decision shows genuine mastery. The specific example of how customer feedback contradicted assumptions and led to repositioning demonstrates practical application at a high level.

This work fully addresses rubric criteria with strong theoretical depth. The quality and sophistication of your integration meets the highest standard. Your examples show you've genuinely internalized the framework and can apply it flexibly.

Your evolution from wanting to "get it right" to embracing experimentation represents meaningful growth. This comfort with uncertainty will serve you well in dynamic career contexts.

### EXAMPLE 3: Distinction (25/30)

**Student Profile:** iLab startup (Aloe Vita), 70 surveys + 30 interviews, strong Lean Startup, mentions Design Thinking

**Key Learnings Extract:**
"The Lean Start Up Method advises us to test assumptions and to fail fast. Our group tested assumptions through survey responses and interviews. We collected 70 survey responses and conducted two sets of 15 interviews... Design Thinking theory focuses on ideating creative solutions rather than the problem. By utilising Design Thinking methods, we have been able to ideate ideas for a sustainable go-to-market strategy."

**Why 7/9:** Strong evidence-based Lean Startup application (70 surveys + 30 interviews), clear recommendations, mentions Design Thinking but could deepen theoretical integration with citations and more sophisticated analysis

**Feedback (167 words):**
This is strong work with thorough Lean Startup application. The 70 surveys and 30 interviews demonstrate substantial evidence-gathering, and your recommendations for Aloe Vita—sample-sized drinks, "healthy indulgence" positioning, aligned retailers—are well-supported. Your honest discussion of team dynamics and proposed role solutions shows leadership maturity. The Faba event networking demonstrates initiative.

To have achieved a higher grade, you would have needed deeper theoretical integration showing HOW frameworks shaped decisions. While you mention Lean Startup's "fail fast" principle, describing specific Build-Measure-Learn cycles, adding citations (Ries), or explaining how assumptions were invalidated would strengthen analysis. Design Thinking receives brief mention—specific empathy mapping examples or ideation process details would add depth.

Your structured approach to validating assumptions and the confidence you've built will serve you well in future ventures. The practical research skills are transferable.

### EXAMPLE 4: Credit (21/30)

**Student Profile:** iLab startup (Eclipse), lab tour, concept posters, some interviews, mentions Lean and Design Thinking with limited depth

**Key Learnings Extract:**
"The most pivotal entrepreneurial framework used throughout my experience with Eclipse was the lean start-up approach. I started by conducting desktop research... I then created two consumer profiles... The assumptions made in our consumer profiles were proven false during these interviews. Thus, we pivoted our target market... The empathy phase of Design Thinking helped me define the right problem."

**Why 5/9:** Mentions Lean Startup and Design Thinking but with limited depth, few specific examples of theory application, lacks sophistication in theory-practice integration, under word count

**Feedback (153 words):**
You've demonstrated good initiative through the Eclipse lab tour, MVP poster creation, and overcoming discomfort with customer interviews. Your honest reflection on communication challenges shows self-awareness, and the realization that "acting makes fears disappear" represents valuable growth. The shift from theoretical understanding to practical application is evident.

To have achieved a higher grade, you would have needed deeper theoretical analysis with specific examples. While you mention Lean Startup and Design Thinking, describing specific Build-Measure-Learn cycles, what pain points emerged from interviews, or how you iterated based on feedback would strengthen the work. The diary entries are more descriptive than reflective—deeper analysis of what experiences taught you about entrepreneurship would add value. The essay is under word count, suggesting opportunity for more detailed reflection.

Your growth in communication skills and comfort with uncertainty is evident. These skills will be transferable to innovation-focused roles.

## SPECIAL CASES

### Word Count
- **Flag if 25% over (>1875 words) or 25% under (<750 words)**
- Don't deduct marks automatically, but note in feedback if significantly affects quality

### Missing Sections
- If a rubric section is completely missing, award 0 marks for that section
- Note clearly in feedback what was missing

### Wrong Format
- If diary entries aren't clearly separated from essay, note but don't penalize heavily if content is there
- If submission is completely wrong format (e.g., PowerPoint), flag for instructor review

### Theory Integration Quality

**⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER COUNT FRAMEWORKS**

- **FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE IN FEEDBACK:**
  - ❌ "You needed to discuss all three frameworks"
  - ❌ "Effectuation receives minimal discussion"
  - ❌ "You should have included Design Thinking/Lean Startup/Effectuation"
  - ❌ "To achieve a higher grade, discuss more frameworks"
  - ❌ Any sentence suggesting missing frameworks as a reason for lower marks

- **CORRECT LANGUAGE FOR IMPROVEMENTS:**
  - ✅ "More specific examples of HOW the framework changed your decisions"
  - ✅ "Additional citations to strengthen theoretical grounding"
  - ✅ "Quantitative results from experiments (conversion rates, test outcomes)"
  - ✅ "Deeper analysis showing cause-effect between theory and practice"
  - ✅ "More detailed Build-Measure-Learn cycles with clear outcomes"

- **MARKING PRINCIPLE:**
  - ONE framework done exceptionally well = **9/9 possible**
  - THREE frameworks done superficially = **4-5/9 maximum**
  - If student discusses NO entrepreneurial frameworks = maximum 4/9
  - **Assess DEPTH not BREADTH:** Citations + specific examples + sophisticated analysis + clear outcomes

- **Quality beats quantity:** Deep integration of ONE framework with citations, specific examples, and sophisticated analysis > superficial mention of all three

### WIL Pathway Considerations
- **iLab/Startup consulting:** Often emphasizes Lean Startup + Design Thinking
- **Own Venture:** Often emphasizes Effectuation + Lean Startup
- **Corporate:** Often emphasizes Design Thinking + Lean Startup
- **These are tendencies, not requirements** - assess based on quality of integration regardless of which framework(s) chosen
