## PART 1: The Overall WIL Experience

**New things I learned about myself**

The overall WIL experience has been a deeply insightful and, at times,
challenging journey of self-discovery. At the beginning of my WIL
placement with Eclipse, I felt slightly apprehensive about navigating a
biotech venture as I possess limited knowledge of the biotechnology
space. However, it soon became apparent that my team and I would be on
the forefront of customer discovery, conducting ‘on-the-ground’ research
and applying design thinking and lean startup tools to generate, test
and refine early-stage insights. Through these activities, I learnt that
I thrive in structured ambiguity, where I can navigate uncertainty
through iterative problem-solving and effective teamwork. This also
showed me that I’m more adaptable that I initially thought.

**Highlights and difficult times**

A personal highlight of my journey with Eclipse was conducting a problem
interview with Rachel, a beauty retail specialist at Mecca Cosmetica.
Throughout our discussion, she mentioned that clients over 30-40 years
old seek anti-aging products and are willing to spend *“\$500 on a
single face cream”*. This was a shocking discovery for me, and I
immediately recognised a high-value market niche that a premium
ingredient like lactoferrin could successfully serve. It felt like a
lightbulb moment where I realised that I could contribute meaningful
commercial insight even in a field I initially felt underqualified in.

Nonetheless, I experienced a key difficulty being unable to attend the
weekly Eclipse meetings with Siobhan due to a class clash. This meant I
only received the insights that were later relayed to me and lacked the
opportunity to ask Siobhan questions that were meaningful to me. As
well, it contributed to a slight feeling of disconnect from Siobhan’s
entrepreneurial mindset and vision.

**How I dealt with challenges**

However, my teammates were extremely proactive in ensuring that at least
one of us was in weekly attendance and taking meeting notes to later
distribute to the rest of the team via Instagram messages and Google
Docs. Additionally, we would request team meetings regularly to ask
clarifying questions and ensure that we were all in task alignment.
Overall, I felt supported by my team members, despite my absence in the
weekly Eclipse meetings, and that helped me stay connected to the
project’s progress and feel included in decision-making.

**What I would do differently in hindsight**

In hindsight, I would take on a more proactive and professional attitude
to the WIL experience. Whilst I have been hands-on throughout the entire
journey with Eclipse, I feel as though I could have tried to connect
with Eclipse collaborators, whether with other members of Eclipse’s team
or, simply, the other WIL students partnered with Eclipse. These
conversations could have provided alternative perspectives on customer
discovery and product positioning that my immediate team might not have
considered. I believe that building these connections would have
strengthened my industry awareness and, therefore, offered long-term
professional benefits.

**Specific networks built**

In saying that, the networks that we did establish were meaningful and
purposeful. We were consistently in close contact with Siobhan either
through email or Zoom meetings, providing firsthand exposure to biotech
entrepreneurship. Within some of these meetings, the second cosmetic
team for Eclipse was present and exchanged similar strategic insights.
Moreover, the interviews we conducted opened channels of conversation
with retail professionals which expanded my understanding of how
ingredient credibility shapes B2B partnerships. Finally, we engaged in
frequent dialogue with our WIL tutor, Jack, whose feedback helped
translate theory into practice throughout the Eclipse project.

**Value derived beyond surface-level benefits**

Connecting these networks helped me understand how cross-disciplinary
expertise ultimately drives innovation. Beyond these benefits, I found
personal value in the leadership and initiative skills I acquired, in
which I learned that entrepreneurial decision-making is made easier
through one’s self-efficacy in navigating ambiguity, asking the right
questions and translating feedback into actionable learning for venture
growth.

## PART 2: New Knowledge, Insights, and Skills

**The past**

Prior to the WIL experience, I had developed a rich understanding of
entrepreneurship. This is attributed to my previous semester of study
within the Innovation and Entrepreneurship major, where topics such as
Lean Startup, Customer Discovery, Business Models and more alike, were
explored extensively. These foundational courses provided me with
theoretical perspectives and a basic understanding of startup
ecosystems. For example, in my Entrepreneurial Mindset and Ideation
(TIMS1301) class, I was tasked with a customer discovery assignment
where I had to conduct two in-depth interviews on a pressing and unmet
consumer demand. This equipped me with early skills in problem
identification and stakeholder communication although I struggled with
translating insights into practical initiatives. Ultimately, this
contributed to my anticipation for this WIL course as it presented the
chance to build on my existing skillset and experience the complexities
of startup development firsthand.

**Key learnings**

Effectuation, as described by *Sarasvathy (2022),* *‘is a logic of
non-predictive control’* grounded in the idea that entrepreneurs can act
despite uncertainty by focusing on what they can control rather than
what they can forecast. This guided my team’s early approach to Eclipse
as there was great ambiguity about market fit and consumer applications
of lactoferrin. The first process of effectuation we employed was the
*Bird-in-hand* principle through a means inventory. We recognised
Siobhan’s biotech expertise, successful funding initiatives and
Eclipse’s QUT lab networks as opportune starting means that guided how
we defined feasible pathways for market validation.

Another effective process we implemented was the *Crazy Quilt* principle
whereby entrepreneurs *‘bring in others to co-create the future’
(Sarasvathy, 2022).* Our stakeholder exchanges with Siobhan, Jack and
retail professionals created a rich co-learning environment wherein the
consolidation of varying viewpoints helped us identify the most
advantageous entry point for Eclipse. These principles were the most
instrumental in guiding my journey with Eclipse and will continue to
shape my professional growth by reinforcing effectual logic as a mindset
for innovation and venture creation.

Moreover, the lean startup framework as defined by *Ries (2011)* to be
*‘a systematic approach to testing hypotheses about product, customer
and market fit’* was integral to our iterative testing process with
Eclipse. In particular, the *build-measure-learn* feedback loop helped
us *‘turn assumptions into knowledge’ (Ries, 2011).* Initially, my team
and I had assumed that the scientific novelty of lactoferrin would drive
consumer interest, specifically for the B2B route as reputable brands
value differentiation.

The business model canvas (BMC) mapped out this assumption, capturing
the key partners and customer segments most likely to adopt
biotech-backed ingredients in premium skincare, and forming the *build*
stage of our feedback loop. Interestingly, when *measuring* our
hypothesis through problem interviews, the responses revealed a demand
for hydration and brand trust over scientific novelty. As *Blank and
Dorf (2020)* reminds us, *‘learning that a hypothesis is wrong is not a
crisis’*, rather a critical step toward refining understanding. This
reflection marked the *learn* stage of the feedback loop, where insights
from real customer data replaced assumptions and informed our next
iteration. In future innovation roles, I will apply this iterative logic
to prototype emerging technologies.

Furthermore, design thinking encouraged me to look beyond surface-level
preferences and uncover the emotional drivers behind consumer behaviour.
*Liedtka and Ogilvie (2011)* define this concept as a *‘systematic
approach to problem-solving that starts with customers’* and thrives on
*‘empathy, invention and iteration.’* An empathy map was created for
each demographic – women, men and retail professionals – to compare
their purchasing behaviours and underlying motivations toward skincare.
We discovered that women sought hydration, men valued convenience, and
retail staff prioritised scientific credibility. By synthesising these
distinct motivations, a clearer market demand emerged, allowing Eclipse
to define a more competitive entry point.

This process was particularly enlightening because I learnt that a
successful innovation requires learning how users think, feel and decide
in order to position the venture at the intersection of user
desirability and market opportunity. For future roles in consulting or
innovation, design thinking can aid in *‘understanding the human context
behind a problem’ (Liedtka & Ogilvie, 2011)* and, ultimately, drive
value creation.

**The future**

This WIL experience has reshaped how I view innovation and
entrepreneurship. The intricacies involved in venture creation, such as
navigating uncertainty, iterative testing and customer discovery, have
refined my approach to creating meaningful innovation. I’ve developed
transferable skills namely, adaptability, leadership and critical
problem-solving skills, that can help me seamlessly adjust to a career
in technological innovation, as I wish to pursue after graduation. In
reflection, I am grateful for the *behind-the-scenes­* exposure this WIL
has provided, as it has inspired a stronger belief in my ability to
launch my own venture in the future.

**Course feedback**

Beyond the real-world startup exposure, I valued learning to think and
act with the adaptability of an entrepreneur. Stepping into that role as
a “market specialist” made the experience feel legitimate and personally
rewarding. If I were to suggest three specific improvements, the first
would be to allocate more on-campus class time. It would be interesting
and beneficial to converse with the class throughout their startup
journeys and exchange advice, fair dues and constructive feedback. Next,
a mentoring session with UQ Ventures would be a valuable addition
because it makes entrepreneurship feel local, visible and achievable. My
final suggestion would be for the groups to be pre-assigned rather than
allowing self-allocation to promote diverse collaboration and push us
beyond familiar working styles.

## Reflective Diary Entries

**Entry 1 — Getting Started (Weeks 1–2: Means Inventory & Orientation)**

Partnering with Eclipse, as part of this Work Integrated Learning (WIL)
course, introduced my team and I to an incredible learning experience,
throughout which I have progressed through distinct stages of
professional and personal growth. At the outset of joining the Eclipse
project I was both intrigued and confused about the biotechnology and
precision fermentation that the company was exploring in lactoferrin. It
became critical to delve deeper into Eclipse’s background and value
proposition to understand why and how my team and I could effectively
contribute to the company’s projected success.

Thus, we began with a Means Inventory to map out Eclipse’s existing
resources, networks and expertise. We believed this approach to be a
valuable starting point given the exploratory nature of Eclipse’s
current market position. Completing the Means Inventory aligned closely
with *Sarasvathy (2022)’s* discussion of effectuation theory, especially
the *bird-in-hand* principle, which suggests that entrepreneurs *‘design
possible effects using a particular set of means’* rather than chasing
fixed outcomes. *Sarasvathy (2022)’s* evaluation also reiterates that
*‘effectuation is useful at points where goals are ambiguous and
equivocal’* which captures the uncertainty Eclipse faces in defining its
market direction.

As part of Eclipse’s skincare-focused team, we discovered that the
company was rich in available resources and connections. These included
Eclipse’s start-up CSIRO funding and connections with QUT laboratories
as well as a diverse and expanding team of strain engineers, scientists,
and Siobhan’s (Eclipse CEO/Founder) personal expertise in food health
alongside business and commercial roles. With this understanding, our
role as “market specialists” feels particularly valuable and
strategically significant.

Ultimately, this first step offers a clear understanding of Eclipse’s
strengths and sets a strong foundation for my team and I to pursue
meaningful research into which markets and demographics would best align
with its resources.

**Entry 2 — Structuring Direction (Weeks 3–4: Business Model Canvas)**

Our entry point is to incorporate lactoferrin in skincare through B2B
partnerships as discussed with Siobhan, which is a promising market
however value spans across many demographics. To help bring structure to
this entry, we have been creating a business model canvas (BMC) which
helps to identify and organise the key factors involved in positioning
the business effectively.

In our first conversation with Siobhan, we reached a decision to target
existing cosmetic manufacturers who already occupied a reputable
position in the market. There was discussion about whether this
partnership would be with mainstream brands such as Cetaphil or La Roche
Posay, or premium and luxury brands seeking novel active ingredients.
Our BMC is corroborating these considerations in assuming that Eclipse’s
resources, such as their R&D capabilities, founder networks and brand
credibility, will provide a strategic indicator as to which key
partners, customer segments and channels are most favourable and
sustainable.

After our team meeting, we have decided to focus on premium skincare
brands as lactoferrin is a highly unique ingredient with anti-aging
effects, making it reasonable to assume that these brands would value
its scientific credibility and differentiation potential. Therefore, our
next progression is to treat this as a hypothesis to be validated
through research and upcoming problem interviews, aiming to confirm if
lactoferrin’s skincare benefits and scientific novelty align with market
demand. Notably, the BMC guided this decision-making under uncertainty
and made me more aware of the clarity that can emerge through iteration
and collaborative learning. It led to a sense of confidence in our
decision as it was based on evidence and extensive research rather than
guesswork.

**Entry 3 — Validating the Problem (Weeks 5–6: Problem Interviews)**

After mapping the BMC, we moved to validate whether the pain point we’d
identified actually exists. Our targeted reach was 30 end-consumers
ranging from women aged 16+, to men who are and are not active skincare
users, to aestheticians and beauty retail workers. This encouraged
diversity across the responses and was in alignment with Siobhan’s
request to broaden demographic representation.

*Table 1. Team coverage across 30 interviews*

As observed in *Table 1.* I conducted 7 interviews across the three
demographic segments. During my first interview, I noticed the questions
were repetitive and unintentionally prompted specific responses. For
instance, one question asked, *“When does a product feel like “good
value” to you - is it the price, the results, or something else?”* I
became aware that this phrasing was inadvertently shaping the
interviewee’s responses. Before moving onto a second interview, I
mentioned my concerns to the rest of the team during a team meeting. At
that point I was made aware that Siobhan corroborated this notion, as
seen in *Figure 1.*, and suggested to keep the questions open, allowing
insights to emerge naturally.

*Figure 1. Email feedback from Siobhan*

We revised the questions accordingly, giving way to detailed and
meaningful responses from the remaining participants. This reiteration
was the critical turning point in our assessment of Eclipse’s value
proposition and demonstrated, to me, the importance of listening for
behaviour, not hypotheticals. This process also reflected an early
application of Lean Startup’s *‘build-measure-learn’* cycle, not through
a physical MVP, but through iterative testing of customer assumptions.
We were able to *build* a hypothesis around lactoferrin’s potential
appeal, *measure* its validity through authentic customer responses and
*learn* which needs were most consistent across demographics *(Ries,
2011).*

**Entry 4 — Understanding the Consumer (Weeks 7–8: Empathy Mapping)**

By week 7 our interviews were mostly completed so we began empathy
mapping. Empathy mapping is the first stage of the design thinking
process, *‘a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand
users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative
solutions to prototype and test’ (Interaction Design Foundation, 2024).*
Thus, in understanding the consumer, we built empathy maps for women,
men and retail professionals, highlighting what the participants say,
think, feel and do.

Our working hypothesis was that lactoferrin presented a highly valuable
and unique product offering to users seeking anti-inflammatory,
antimicrobial and anti-aging benefits. Each demographic revealed unique
insights, with women desiring hydration and visible results, men
concerned mostly with convenience and affordability, and retail workers
valuing scientific credibility and proof of effectiveness. Observing
each demographic’s needs in isolation made it easier to compare their
pains and gains, as well as recognise commonalities between them. After
team consolidation, we realised that trust and effectiveness were the
most recurring needs.

This realisation challenged our initial assumptions that the science
behind lactoferrin would be the main selling point. Instead, trust from
brand legitimacy and observed results became the key drivers of
perceived value. This finding reaffirmed the iterative nature of the
lean startup cycle where validated learning emerges through continuous
feedback rather than assumptions. This stage was particularly insightful
as we unpacked why consumers make certain purchasing decisions and,
therefore, helping me to recognise how understanding user motivations
strengthens the fit between innovation and market reality.

**Entry 5 — Measuring Real Reactions (Weeks 9–10: Survey Validation &
Final Insights)**

Approaching Week 13, my team and I have closed the survey after
distributing flyers around campus and local networks for the past two
weeks. 57 respondents answered a series of questions about their
skincare priorities and preferences to help validate and refine our
earlier assumptions. This is our second iteration of consumer research,
designed to translate the qualitative insights from empathy mapping into
measurable data trends that could guide Eclipse’s market positioning.

*Figure 2. Bus stop flyer for survey promotion*

Nearing the end of this journey, after communicating with a range of
stakeholders, I feel more confident in speaking with new and diverse
people and approaching unfamiliar situations with curiosity rather than
hesitation; a mindset I’ll carry into future ventures and professional
environments.
