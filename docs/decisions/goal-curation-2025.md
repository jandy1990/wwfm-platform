# Goal Curation Decision - January 2025

## 🔴 Critical Discovery: Not All Goals Fit Our Model

### The Key Insight
We analyzed our 781 goals and discovered they fall into 4 distinct tiers:

- **Tier 1: Specific & Solvable** (~250 goals, 32%) - Clear problems with measurable solutions
- **Tier 2: Skills & Capabilities** (~200 goals, 26%) - Learnable abilities with progression
- **Tier 3: Medical & Health Conditions** (~150 goals, 19%) - Complex conditions needing professional treatment
- **Tier 4: Life Philosophies & Journeys** (~180 goals, 23%) - Subjective, philosophical challenges

**The Problem**: Only Tier 1-2 goals (~450 total, 58%) actually work well with our solution-rating model. Tier 4 goals like "Find my purpose" or "Love myself" don't have rateable solutions.

### The Decision
We curated the original 781 goals down to 228 high-quality, actionable goals that fit WWFM's solution-rating model. This ensures:
- Every goal has concrete, rateable solutions
- Users get actionable advice, not philosophical guidance
- The platform maintains its core value proposition

### Implementation
- **Original goals**: 781 across all tiers
- **After curation**: 228 focused goals (primarily Tier 1-2)
- **Archived**: ~550 goals that didn't fit the model
- **Result**: 99.6% of remaining goals now have solutions (227/228)

### Why This Was the Right Decision
1. **Quality over Quantity**: 228 actionable goals > 781 mixed-quality goals
2. **User Value**: Every goal now has concrete, testable solutions
3. **Platform Integrity**: Maintains focus on "what actually worked" vs philosophical advice
4. **Scalability**: Easier to maintain high-quality solutions for focused goal set

### Archived Goals
The removed goals are archived and can be retrieved if needed, but they fundamentally don't fit WWFM's model of crowdsourcing specific, rateable solutions. Examples of removed goals:
- "Find my purpose in life" (too philosophical)
- "Love myself" (too subjective)
- "Be more spiritual" (no concrete solutions)
- "Achieve enlightenment" (not measurable)

### Impact
This curation enabled us to achieve:
- **99.6% goal coverage** with solutions
- **Average 24.5 solutions per goal**
- **Clear, actionable advice** for every goal
- **Maintained platform focus** on evidence-based solutions
