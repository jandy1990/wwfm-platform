# Column Overlap Error Documentation

## Problem Description
Persistent text overlap issue in the goal[id]/page where the CHALLENGES and FREQUENCY columns overlap in desktop view. The overlap occurs in the Key Fields section of solution cards, making text unreadable.

## Screenshot Analysis
- Location: Key Fields grid section (3-column layout on desktop)
- Affected fields: CHALLENGES (with percentages) overlapping into FREQUENCY column
- Pattern: Long text with percentages like "Difficulty concentrating " Restlessness " Emotional overwhelm" extends beyond column boundaries

## Previous Attempts (User Reported)
1. **Overflow hidden** - Added but didn't prevent overlap
2. **Line-height adjustments** - Improved spacing but didn't fix column bleed
3. **Text wrapping** - Attempted but incomplete

## Current Code Structure

### GoalPageClient.tsx (line 986)
```tsx
<div className="hidden sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3 gap-x-6 gap-y-4 mb-4">
```

### Issues Identified
1. Fixed `grid-cols-3` doesn't account for content width
2. `gap-x-6` (1.5rem) insufficient for preventing overlap
3. No explicit column containment
4. formatArrayField returns JSX with divs that can expand beyond boundaries
5. No overflow control on individual grid cells

## Root Cause Analysis
The grid system relies on content to respect implicit boundaries, but:
- Array fields with percentages create wider content
- No explicit width constraints on grid cells
- CSS grid allows content to overflow into adjacent cells without containment

## Solution Approach

### 1. Grid Structure Fix
- Add explicit column isolation
- Use minimum column widths
- Implement proper overflow handling

### 2. CSS Containment
- Create dedicated classes for key fields grid
- Add overflow and word-break rules
- Ensure proper text wrapping

### 3. Content Wrapping
- Wrap field values in container divs
- Apply overflow rules at multiple levels
- Respect column boundaries

## Implementation Tracking

### Attempt #1 (Current)
- Date: 2025-07-10
- Strategy: Systematic grid containment with multiple safeguards
- Changes:
  - Grid layout: Moving to responsive columns with min-width
  - CSS: Adding explicit containment classes
  - JSX: Wrapping content in overflow containers

### Implementation Details

#### 1. GoalPageClient.tsx Changes:
- Line 986: Changed grid from `sm:grid-cols-3` to `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- Added `key-fields-grid` class for CSS targeting
- Increased gap from `gap-x-6` to `gap-x-8` for more spacing
- Wrapped each field in `field-container` div with `min-w-0`
- Changed value span to `field-value-container` div

#### 2. formatArrayField Function Updates:
- Added `overflow-hidden` to all container divs
- For challenges with percentages: Added `truncate` class with title attribute
- For percentage fields: Changed to inline-block spans with proper wrapping
- Added `break-words` class for long content

#### 3. CSS Changes (globals.css):
- Added `.key-fields-grid` with `isolation: isolate` to prevent overlap
- `.field-container`: overflow handling, word-wrap, hyphens, min-width: 0
- `.field-value-container`: overflow hidden, text-overflow ellipsis, word-break
- Media queries for responsive grid columns with minimum widths
- Special handling for challenges with percentages

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Long challenge descriptions with percentages
- [ ] Multiple items in array fields
- [ ] Different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Both simple and detailed views
- [ ] Dark mode compatibility

### Summary of Fix:
This implementation uses a multi-layered approach to prevent column overlap:

1. **Responsive Grid**: Changed from fixed 3-column to 2-column on tablets, 3-column on desktop
2. **Explicit Containment**: Added container divs with overflow control at multiple levels
3. **CSS Isolation**: Used `isolation: isolate` to prevent grid items from overlapping
4. **Smart Truncation**: Long text with percentages gets truncated with ellipsis and tooltips
5. **Increased Spacing**: Gap increased from 1.5rem to 2rem for better separation

The key insight was that CSS Grid allows content to overflow into adjacent cells unless explicitly contained. By adding proper overflow handling and grid isolation, we ensure each column's content stays within its boundaries.

### Update #2 - Fixed Text Cutoff Issue
- Date: 2025-07-10
- Issue: Previous fix caused text to be cut off with ellipsis instead of wrapping
- Solution: Modified approach to allow text wrapping while maintaining column boundaries

#### Changes Made:

1. **formatArrayField Function** (GoalPageClient.tsx):
   - Removed `truncate` class from challenges with percentages
   - Changed to `break-words` to allow text wrapping
   - For percentage fields: Used flex-wrap layout with proper spacing
   - Removed `overflow-hidden` from containers to prevent cutoff

2. **CSS Updates** (globals.css):
   - Removed `text-overflow: ellipsis` from `.field-value-container`
   - Removed `overflow: hidden` to allow content to wrap naturally
   - Kept `word-break: break-word` for proper text breaking
   - Updated selector from `.field-container:has(.text-sm.truncate)` to `.field-container:has(.space-y-1)`

#### Result:
Text now wraps properly within column boundaries without being cut off. The challenges field displays all content while respecting the grid layout, preventing both overlap and truncation.

### Update #3 - Goal Page UI Fixes
- Date: 2025-07-10
- Issues: Description placement, missing per-card toggle, and visual feedback
- Reference: goalsolutionspage.html design specification

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Description placement** - Was at the bottom of cards, needed to be at top (under title/variant)
2. **Missing per-card toggle** - Cards weren't individually clickable to switch between simple/detailed views
3. **Visual feedback** - Cards needed better hover states to indicate they're interactive

#### Changes Made:

##### 1. Description Placement Fix
**File:** `/components/goal/GoalPageClient.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Moved description to appear immediately after the solution header (line 984-988)
- Removed duplicate description from simple view (was at line 1156-1160)
- Removed description from detailed view section (was at line 1089-1095)

**Result:** Description now appears at the top of each card, right after the title and variant info, matching the design spec

##### 2. Per-Card Toggle Implementation
**File:** `/components/goal/GoalPageClient.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced `toggleCardView` function (lines 635-657) to properly exclude interactive elements:
  - Added checks for `.swipeable-rating`
  - Added checks for `.side-effect-chip`
  - Added checks for `.add-effect-inline`
  - Added checks for `.view-options-button`
- Added `cursor-pointer` class to article element (line 886)
- Added `title` attribute with tooltip text (line 888)

**Result:** Clicking anywhere on a card (except interactive elements) now toggles between simple and detailed views

##### 3. Visual Feedback Enhancements
**File:** `/app/globals.css`

**Changes (lines 372-415):**
- Increased hover transform from -1px to -2px for more noticeable effect
- Enhanced box-shadow on hover from `0 2px 8px` to `0 4px 12px`
- Updated hover border color to lighter purple (`#a78bfa`)
- Changed detailed view background:
  - Light mode: `#faf5ff` (light purple tint)
  - Dark mode: `rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.05)` (subtle purple glow)
- Added visual indicator pseudo-element that appears on hover (top-right corner)

**Result:** Cards now have clear visual feedback showing they're interactive

#### Testing Completed:
- ✅ Development server tested at http://localhost:3004
- ✅ Description appears at top of cards in both simple and detailed views
- ✅ Cards toggle individually when clicked
- ✅ Interactive elements (ratings, buttons) don't trigger card toggle
- ✅ Hover effects working on desktop
- ✅ Mobile swipe functionality preserved
- ✅ Global view toggle still overrides individual card states

#### Technical Notes:
- Used React event handling with `event.target.closest()` to detect clicks on interactive elements
- Maintained existing mobile swipe functionality with SwipeableRating component
- CSS transitions set to 0.2s for smooth animations
- Dark mode fully supported with appropriate color adjustments
