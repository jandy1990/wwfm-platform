✅ TypeScript Standards
All components use proper TypeScript interfaces
Environment variables properly typed with assertions
Error handling with typed error objects
Form validation with type-safe state management
✅ Component Patterns
Client components marked with 'use client' directive
Server components (layout) handle metadata and global configuration
Reusable component architecture with props interfaces
Consistent error handling and loading state patterns
✅ Styling Standards
Tailwind CSS utility classes used consistently
Responsive design with mobile-first approach
Focus states and accessibility considerations
Color scheme and typography hierarchy established
5. Environment Setup
5.1 Development Environment (Verified Working)
✅ Local Development Setup
Node.js: Compatible version running
Next.js: 15.3.2 development server operational
TypeScript: Compilation successful with no blocking errors
Tailwind CSS: Styling system working with hot reloading
VS Code: Configured with proper folder structure and extensions
✅ Project Structure Resolution
Issue Resolved: Nested folder structure that was blocking development
Solution: VS Code opened in correct inner wwfm-platform folder
Impact: All import paths now resolve correctly, TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Environment Variables
Location: .env.local in project root
Status: Supabase credentials loaded and working
Security: Properly excluded from version control via .gitignore
5.2 Development Workflow Established
✅ Version Control
Git: Repository properly initialized and connected to GitHub
Commits: Ready for committing authentication implementation
Branches: Working on main branch with clean commit history
✅ Testing Procedures
Authentication Flow: Manual testing of signup/signin forms successful
Error Handling: Error states and validation working properly
Browser Compatibility: Tested in both regular and incognito modes
Responsive Design: Verified working across different screen sizes
✅ Development Commands
bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Clear Next.js cache (if needed)
rm -rf .next && npm run dev

# Install new dependencies
npm install [package-name]
5.3 Known Development Environment Issues
⚠️ Browser Extension Interference
Issue: Hydration errors in main browser (not incognito)
Cause: Browser extensions modifying DOM before React hydration
Impact: No impact on functionality, cosmetic development error only
Workaround: Use incognito mode for testing, or ignore errors during development
⚠️ Email Delivery in Development
Issue: Development emails may be slow or go to spam
Cause: Using Supabase built-in email service with rate limits
Impact: Email verification may take 1-5 minutes to arrive
Solution: Check spam folder, or implement custom SMTP for production
