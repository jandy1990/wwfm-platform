2. Database Schema
2.1 Critical Design Decisions
User ID Architecture: public.users.id MUST equal auth.users.id for RLS security

Navigation Structure (Updated May 31, 2025):

Simplified from Arena → Category → Goal to Arena → Goal
Categories table remains but is not used in navigation
Goals now have direct arena_id foreign key
User Creation Trigger:

sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user() 
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, username, contribution_points, ratings_count, solutions_count, comments_count)
  VALUES (new.id, new.email, COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'username', split_part(new.email, '@', 1)), 0, 0, 0, 0);
  RETURN new;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN unique_violation THEN
    RETURN new; -- User already exists, that's fine
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
2.2 Core Tables
arenas
sql
CREATE TABLE arenas (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  icon VARCHAR(50),
  display_order INTEGER,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
categories (Deprecated - Not used in navigation)
sql
-- Still exists in database but not used in application navigation
-- Kept for data integrity, may be removed in future migration
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  arena_id UUID REFERENCES arenas(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  display_order INTEGER,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
goals (Updated May 31, 2025)
sql
CREATE TABLE goals (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  arena_id UUID REFERENCES arenas(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Direct relationship
  category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id), -- Legacy, being phased out
  title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  -- Note: slug column does not exist (discovered May 31)
  view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  -- Note: solution_count column does not exist (discovered May 31)
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);

-- Constraints added May 31, 2025
ALTER TABLE goals 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_goals_arena 
FOREIGN KEY (arena_id) REFERENCES arenas(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_goals_arena_id ON goals(arena_id);
solutions (Updated June 2025)
sql
CREATE TABLE solutions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  goal_id UUID REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  detailed_steps TEXT,
  time_investment VARCHAR(100),
  cost_estimate VARCHAR(100),
  difficulty_level INTEGER CHECK (difficulty_level >= 1 AND difficulty_level <= 5),
  avg_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
  rating_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  tags TEXT[],
  mechanism_tags TEXT[],
  minimum_dose VARCHAR(100),

  verification_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
ratings
sql
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  solution_id UUID REFERENCES solutions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  effectiveness_score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (effectiveness_score >= 1 AND effectiveness_score <= 5),

  pros TEXT[],
  cons TEXT[],
  secondary_impacts JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  UNIQUE(solution_id, user_id)
);
2.3 Additional Tables (from May 29)
solution_enrichments - Progressive disclosure system
solution_completion_tracking - Tracks entry completeness
notification_queue - Smart prompts for users
goal_suggestions - User-submitted goal ideas
2.4 Triangle Architecture (June 2025)
The ratings table serves as the convergence point of the WWFM triangle:

Person: user_id (who tried it)
Solution: solution_id (what they tried)
Problem/Goal: accessed via solution.goal_id (what problem they were solving)
This architecture supports future personalization without requiring immediate user profiling.

3. Row Level Security (RLS) Architecture
3.1 Core Principles
Public Read, Private Write - Aggregated data must be publicly accessible
Anonymous First - Most browsing happens without authentication
Business Logic Alignment - RLS must match platform goals
Explicit Over Implicit - Clear policies prevent confusion
3.2 RLS Policies (All tables have RLS enabled)
See previous documentation for detailed policies. All policies remain unchanged and functioning correctly.

4. Authentication Implementation (Completely Revised May 31, 2025)
4.1 Authentication Architecture
Key Change: Migrated from @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs to @supabase/ssr due to Next.js 15 compatibility issues.

Server-Side Client (/lib/supabase-server.ts)
typescript
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export async function createSupabaseServerClient() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies() // Next.js 15 requires await
  
  return createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return cookieStore.getAll()
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          try {
            cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) =>
              cookieStore.set(name, value, options)
            )
          } catch {
            // Server Component cookie setting - can be ignored
          }
        },
      },
    }
  )
}
Client-Side (/lib/supabase.ts)
typescript
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

export function createSupabaseBrowserClient() {
  return createBrowserClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
  )
}

// For backward compatibility
export const supabase = createSupabaseBrowserClient()
Middleware (/middleware.ts)
typescript
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  let supabaseResponse = NextResponse.next({ request })

  const supabase = createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return request.cookies.getAll()
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          // Update both request and response cookies
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
            request.cookies.set(name, value)
            supabaseResponse.cookies.set(name, value, options)
          })
        },
      },
    }
  )

  // CRITICAL: Use getUser() not getSession() for proper refresh
  await supabase.auth.getUser()

  return supabaseResponse
}
4.2 Components ✅ COMPLETE
AuthContext.tsx: Uses new browser client
SignUpForm.tsx: User registration with email verification
SignInForm.tsx: User login with error handling
ResetPasswordForm.tsx: Password reset request
UpdatePasswordForm.tsx: Password update after reset
ProtectedRoute.tsx: Updated to use createSupabaseBrowserClient()
SolutionForm.tsx: Updated to use new auth pattern
4.3 Auth Flow
Registration → Email verification → Dashboard
Login → Session creation → Dashboard
Password Reset → Email link → Update → Dashboard
Protected Routes → Check auth → Redirect if needed
Key Fix: Middleware now properly refreshes expired sessions
4.4 Server Component Usage Pattern
typescript
// All server components must await the client
const supabase = await createSupabaseServerClient()
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()

11. Key User Flows
11.1 Browse & Discovery Flow ✅ COMPLETE
Implementation: /app/browse → /app/arena/[slug] → /app/goal/[id]

User lands on /browse seeing all arenas with icons
Clicks arena (e.g., "Feel better emotionally") → /arena/feel-better-emotionally
Views goals in natural language → "Stop feeling overwhelmed all the time"
Clicks specific goal → /goal/[id]
Sees solutions with effectiveness ratings (⭐ 4.5 with count)
Technical Notes:

Uses createSupabaseServerClient() for all data fetching
Public read access via RLS policies
Goals fetched with arena_id foreign key (categories deprecated)
11.2 User Registration & Onboarding ✅ COMPLETE
Implementation: /app/auth/signup → email verification → /dashboard

User signs up with email at /auth/signup
Supabase sends verification email
User clicks link → /auth/callback handles token
handle_new_user() trigger creates public.users record
Redirect to dashboard
Technical Notes:

Email verification required (Supabase setting)
User ID sync between auth.users and public.users critical
Session management via @supabase/ssr
11.3 Solution Contribution ✅ BUILT (Testing Next)
Implementation: /app/goal/[id]/add-solution with SolutionForm component

Authenticated user on goal page
Clicks "Share What Worked" (requires auth)
Fills two-section form:
Section 1: Detailed success (1-5 stars)
Section 2: Quick-add failures
Submission creates:
Solution record with effectiveness
Rating record linked to user
Updates to aggregated scores
Technical Notes:

Form at /components/auth/solutions/SolutionForm.tsx
Protected route with auth check
Effectiveness-based conditional fields
Pre-populated autocomplete planned
11.4 AI Foundation Flow 🆕 PLANNED
Implementation: TBD

Admin generates AI-researched solutions
Solutions marked with source_type = 'ai_researched'
Display with 🤖 "AI Foundation" badge
Users can verify/improve/challenge

Eventually replaced by human wisdom
11.5 Rating Solutions 📋 PLANNED
Implementation: TBD

User finds solution on goal page
Clicks "I tried this"
Rates effectiveness (1-5 stars)
Optional: detailed review
Updates avg_rating and rating_count
Technical Considerations:

One rating per user per solution (unique constraint)
Aggregation via database triggers or application logic
Consider real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
11.6 Future Flows (Not Implemented)

14. Session Transition Notes
🧠 Key Philosophical Discussion (June Session)
The Triangle Model Proposal
Concept: WWFM as a triangle connecting:

Problems/Goals
Solutions/Strategies
The Person (with rich demographic/psychological/physical data)
Assessment: While powerful for personalization, this represents a fundamental shift from the current privacy-first philosophy.

Decision: Proceed with privacy-first MVP, consider triangle model for Phase 2

Rationale: Need to build trust before requesting intimate data
Path Forward: Make personalization optional, not required
Key Insight: Aggregate wisdom must work without personal data
Philosophical Tensions Identified:
Privacy vs. Personalization - Can't have "privacy enables honesty" while collecting extensive personal data
Simplicity vs. Complexity - Rich profiles add significant friction
Universal Patterns vs. Individual Matching - Both valuable but pull in different directions
Recommendation Adopted:
Phase 1: Anonymous aggregation (current MVP)
Phase 2: Optional context/profiles
Phase 3: Progressive personalization based on user comfort
This preserves the "Wikipedia for wisdom" accessibility while allowing future enhancement.

🏗️ Architecture Decisions
The Triangle Architecture Confirmed
Ratings table is the convergence point of the triangle
Every rating connects: WHO tried WHAT for WHICH PROBLEM
Current schema already captures everything needed
User profiles can be added later without changing core structure
Solution Pre-Population Strategy (Revolutionary!)
Problem: Cold start - empty platform discourages participation

Decision: "AI Foundation" approach

AI-generated solutions marked transparently as "AI-researched"
Users invited to verify, improve, and "out-human" the AI
Shows human experience + AI computation creating something greater
Why This Works:

No deception (full transparency)
Provides immediate value
Sets quality baseline
Gamifies contribution ("beat the bot")
Demonstrates WWFM philosophy in action
Implementation:

typescript
source_type: 'ai_researched' | 'human_verified' | 'community_contributed'
📊 Session Progress
Completed Today:
✅ Reviewed solution form pre-population logic
✅ Confirmed triangle architecture is already in place
✅ Decided against complex user_context JSON
✅ Researched cold start strategies (Reddit's fake accounts vs Wikipedia's community transfer)
✅ Developed innovative "AI Foundation" approach
Key Insights:
Pre-fill is working but no solutions exist yet to populate
The ratings table already captures the complete triangle
Transparency transforms "fake" content into collaborative foundation
Human wisdom + AI research = revolutionary approach
🎯 Next Session Priorities:
🔴 Priority 1: Create AI Foundation Content

Generate 5-10 high-quality solutions per arena
Mark clearly as AI-researched
Focus on common, well-documented solutions
🟡 Priority 2: Test Solution Submission

Submit both AI and human solutions
Verify database storage
Test the complete flow
🟢 Priority 3: Design Solution Display

Show source_type badges
Implement verification counts
Create engaging UI for human vs AI content
🤔 Design Decisions Needed:
Visual design for AI vs human content markers
Verification flow - how users confirm/improve AI content
Transition strategy - when does human content replace AI foundation?
💡 Philosophical Evolution:
We're not building a platform that replaces human wisdom with AI - we're demonstrating how AI can create the foundation that enables human wisdom to flourish. This is bigger than solving cold start - it's a new model for human-AI collaboration.

Status: The authentication system is fully functional, the triangle architecture is confirmed, and the AI Foundation strategy provides a revolutionary approach to the cold start problem. Next phase is generating AI content and testing the complete solution submission flow.
