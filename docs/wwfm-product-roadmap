## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines WWFM's evolution from a goal discovery platform to a wisdom-cultivation system that helps people find what actually works. We start with immediate user needs while building toward deeper transformation through collective intelligence and mechanism understanding.

## Core Product Principles

1. **Start where users are** - Immediate problems and specific goals
2. **Reveal deeper patterns** - Surface wisdom from collective experience  
3. **Enable transformation** - Move from symptom management to root causes
4. **Respect user agency** - Guide without prescribing
5. **Understand mechanisms** - Track HOW solutions work, not just what they are
