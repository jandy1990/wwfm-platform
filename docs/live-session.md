Live Session - December 12, 2024
üìä Major Accomplishments:
Solution Types Complete Overhaul
From Abstract to Human-Centric:

‚ùå Replaced 4 abstract categories (dosage-based, time-based, protocol-based, resource-based)
‚úÖ Created 17 user-centric categories that match natural language
‚úÖ Mapped to 8 reusable form templates for efficient development
‚úÖ Validated against 20 random goals (100% fit)
‚úÖ Verified with 45+ real user testimonials from Reddit/forums

The 17 Solution Categories:
Things you take: Supplements/Vitamins, Medications, Natural remedies
People you see: Therapists/Counselors, Doctors/Specialists, Coaches/Mentors
Things you do: Exercise/Movement, Meditation/Mindfulness, Habits/Routines, Hobbies/Activities, Groups/Communities
Things you use: Apps/Software, Products/Devices, Books/Courses
Changes you make: Diet/Nutrition, Sleep, Environment/Lifestyle
Created Artifacts:

"WWFM Solution Types & Form Design Reference" - complete implementation guide
"WWFM Solution Categories & Form Templates Complete Reference" - SQL schemas and logic
"WWFM Technical Reference - Updated December 2024" - fully updated with changes marked

Key Design Decisions:

Specific Names Over Generic

Users say "I started taking Vitamin D" not "I tried a supplement"
Solution names are specific, categories handle grouping


Auto-Categorization is Essential

Users just type what they tried
System categorizes using keywords/patterns
Falls back to category picker if unknown


Progressive Enrichment

4 universal required fields only
Optional fields can be added later
Maximizes completion rates


Smart Cost Fields

Context-aware based on category
Monthly for supplements, per-session for therapy, etc.
Can toggle between options


Admin Review + Confidence Check

New solutions need creator confidence verification
Admin reviews within 24 hours
Prevents miscategorization from propagating



üèóÔ∏è Architectural Impact:
Database Changes Required:
sql-- Rename existing field
ALTER TABLE solutions RENAME COLUMN solution_type TO solution_category;

-- New tables needed
CREATE TABLE form_templates (
  template_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  cost_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  categories TEXT[],
  required_fields JSONB NOT NULL,
  optional_fields JSONB NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE category_keywords (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  keywords TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  patterns TEXT[]
);
Three-Layer Architecture PRESERVED:

Solutions: Generic approaches (one "Vitamin D" for all uses)
Solution Implementations: Specific variants (1000 IU daily, 5000 IU weekly)
Goal-Implementation Links: Effectiveness ratings per goal+variant combo

This critical architecture enables keystone solution identification and prevents duplication.
üéØ Next Session Priorities:
üî¥ Priority 1: Implement Database Changes

Add solution_category field to solutions table
Create form_templates table with 8 templates
Create category_keywords table for auto-categorization
Migrate any existing solution_type data

üî¥ Priority 2: Build Auto-Categorization

Implement keyword matching logic
Add pattern recognition rules
Create fallback category picker UI
Add creator confidence check modal

üü° Priority 3: Update Solution Form

Refactor to use 8 form templates
Implement smart cost fields
Add progressive field disclosure
Connect to auto-categorization

üü¢ Priority 4: Admin Review Queue

Create admin dashboard for new solutions
Add approval/recategorization workflow
Track review metrics

üí° Key Insights:
Research Validated Our Approach:

Healthcare has the most sophisticated taxonomies (BCTTv1) but they're too complex for general users
No universal framework exists - each domain evolved its own
Multi-dimensional classification is essential but we're handling it through our three-layer architecture
User-centered design beats theoretical perfection

Real User Language Matters:
Analysis of 45+ "what worked for me" testimonials showed people describe solutions exactly as our 17 categories predict. They don't think in abstract medical or academic terms.
Simplicity Enables Completion:
By keeping only 4 required fields and making them universal, we can achieve high completion rates while gathering rich data through progressive enrichment.
üèóÔ∏è Technical Debt Added:

Need to implement all new tables and fields
SolutionForm.tsx needs complete refactor
Need 8 new form template components
Auto-categorization system needs building
Admin tools don't exist yet

üíé Quote of the Session:
"We're overcomplicating things. While healthcare professionals might be applying complicated intervention techniques based on overlapping mechanisms and temporal considerations, that complexity doesn't need to live in our platform. For someone seeing a psychologist - all they are doing is seeing a psychologist."
This crystallized our entire approach - hide complexity, surface simplicity.
üìà Progress Metrics:

‚úÖ Solution categorization system: 100% designed
‚úÖ Form templates: 100% specified
‚¨ú Database implementation: 0% (next priority)
‚¨ú Auto-categorization: 0% (next priority)
‚¨ú Admin tools: 0% (needed soon)
