📋 Live Session Update - DosageForm Improvements
Session Context (December 2024)
Project: WWFM (What Works For Me) - A platform that organizes solutions by what they do (solve problems) rather than what they are (products/services).
Focus: Improving the DosageForm to capture better data and provide clearer user experience.
🎯 What We Accomplished Today
1. ✅ Restructured Form Flow

Moved dosage to Step 1 - Users now specify WHAT they took before rating effectiveness
Made dosage required - For medications/supplements/natural remedies (not beauty)
Created logical progression: Specify → Rate → Report → Compare

2. ✅ Implemented Structured Dosage Input

Replaced free text with Amount + Unit dropdowns to prevent duplicates
Added "Other" option for edge cases with custom unit input
Shows preview of what implementation name will be created
Category-specific units (mg/IU for supplements, pumps/drops for skincare)

3. ✅ Special Handling for Beauty/Skincare

Recognized key difference: Product name matters more than dosage
Simplified to frequency only - "Twice daily", "Night only", etc.
Structured frequency options to prevent variations

4. ✅ Fixed "What Didn't Work" Section

Now accepts ANY solution type - Not limited to same category
Uses 5-star rating system - Matches our standard
Clear context: "didn't work as well as X for Y goal"

5. ✅ Improved Goal Context Throughout

Shows actual goal title everywhere (e.g., "clearing up acne")
Context-aware prompts throughout the form
Fixed goalTitle prop passing from parent component

6. ✅ Added Daily Dose Calculation

Stores both specific regimen ("500mg twice daily")
AND calculated daily total (1000mg) for future roll-up views

🔍 Current Objective
Testing the DosageForm implementation to ensure:

Data quality through structured input
Clear user experience with new flow
Proper variant creation in database

🚀 Immediate Next Steps
1. Remove Count Field

Identified as confusing in current implementation
Users can specify tablets/capsules as the unit itself
Simplifies to just Amount + Unit

2. Test Complete Form Flow

 Test with medications (required dosage)
 Test with supplements (required dosage)
 Test with beauty products (frequency only)
 Test "What didn't work" with cross-category solutions
 Verify implementation names are created correctly
 Check database storage of all fields

3. Validate Key Scenarios

 As-needed medications
 Custom units via "Other" option
 Beauty products with same name but different frequencies
 Failed solutions ratings

📊 Architecture Decisions Made

Keep Implementation Layer for All Categories - Even beauty/skincare, to maintain consistency
Structure Over Flexibility - Dropdowns prevent duplicate data
Progressive Disclosure - Required fields first, optional details last
Cross-Category Comparisons - "What didn't work" accepts any solution type

🎉 Key Achievements
The form now:

Captures clean, structured data avoiding duplicates
Guides users naturally through the reporting process
Preserves important distinctions (10mg vs 20mg, daily vs twice daily)
Enables future roll-ups while maintaining specificity

Ready to remove the Count field and complete testing! 🚀
