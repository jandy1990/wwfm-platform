üß† Key Philosophical Discussion (June Session)
The Triangle Model Proposal
Concept: WWFM as a triangle connecting:

Problems/Goals
Solutions/Strategies
The Person (with rich demographic/psychological/physical data)

Assessment: While powerful for personalization, this represents a fundamental shift from the current privacy-first philosophy.
Decision: Proceed with privacy-first MVP, consider triangle model for Phase 2

Rationale: Need to build trust before requesting intimate data
Path Forward: Make personalization optional, not required
Key Insight: Aggregate wisdom must work without personal data

Philosophical Tensions Identified:

Privacy vs. Personalization - Can't have "privacy enables honesty" while collecting extensive personal data
Simplicity vs. Complexity - Rich profiles add significant friction
Universal Patterns vs. Individual Matching - Both valuable but pull in different directions

Recommendation Adopted:

Phase 1: Anonymous aggregation (current MVP)
Phase 2: Optional context/profiles
Phase 3: Progressive personalization based on user comfort

This preserves the "Wikipedia for wisdom" accessibility while allowing future enhancement.
üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions
The Triangle Architecture Confirmed

Ratings table is the convergence point of the triangle
Every rating connects: WHO tried WHAT for WHICH PROBLEM
Current schema already captures everything needed
User profiles can be added later without changing core structure

Solution Pre-Population Strategy (Revolutionary!)
Problem: Cold start - empty platform discourages participation
Decision: "AI Foundation" approach

AI-generated solutions marked transparently as "AI-researched"
Users invited to verify, improve, and "out-human" the AI
Shows human experience + AI computation creating something greater

Why This Works:

No deception (full transparency)
Provides immediate value
Sets quality baseline
Gamifies contribution ("beat the bot")
Demonstrates WWFM philosophy in action

Implementation:
typescriptsource_type: 'ai_researched' | 'human_verified' | 'community_contributed'
üìä Session Progress
Completed Today:

‚úÖ Reviewed solution form pre-population logic
‚úÖ Confirmed triangle architecture is already in place
‚úÖ Decided against complex user_context JSON
‚úÖ Researched cold start strategies (Reddit's fake accounts vs Wikipedia's community transfer)
‚úÖ Developed innovative "AI Foundation" approach

Key Insights:

Pre-fill is working but no solutions exist yet to populate
The ratings table already captures the complete triangle
Transparency transforms "fake" content into collaborative foundation
Human wisdom + AI research = revolutionary approach

üéØ Next Session Priorities:
üî¥ Priority 1: Create AI Foundation Content

Generate 5-10 high-quality solutions per arena
Mark clearly as AI-researched
Focus on common, well-documented solutions

üü° Priority 2: Test Solution Submission

Submit both AI and human solutions
Verify database storage
Test the complete flow

üü¢ Priority 3: Design Solution Display

Show source_type badges
Implement verification counts
Create engaging UI for human vs AI content

ü§î Design Decisions Needed:

Visual design for AI vs human content markers
Verification flow - how users confirm/improve AI content
Transition strategy - when does human content replace AI foundation?

üí° Philosophical Evolution:
We're not building a platform that replaces human wisdom with AI - we're demonstrating how AI can create the foundation that enables human wisdom to flourish. This is bigger than solving cold start - it's a new model for human-AI collaboration.
Status: Ready to implement the AI Foundation strategy and test the full solution submission flow!
