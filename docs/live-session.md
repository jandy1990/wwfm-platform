🎯 Next Session Priorities
Priority 1: Test Complete Solution Flow 🧪
End-to-end testing of solution submission:

Navigate to goal
Click "Share What Worked"
Submit solution with implementation
Verify all records created correctly:

Solution record (if new)
Solution implementation record
Goal implementation link
Rating record


Confirm display on goal page with proper effectiveness rating

Priority 2: Generate First AI Content 🤖
Create initial AI-generated solutions:

Pick one arena (suggest "Physical Health")
Generate 5-10 solutions using AI
Mark with source_type: 'ai_generated'
Test display with AI badges
Ensure variety of implementation types

Priority 3: Implement Category Pages 📂
Currently missing from the navigation flow:

Create /app/category/[slug]/page.tsx
Display all goals in that category
Show category description
Include stats (number of goals, solutions)

Priority 4: TypeForm-Style Solution Form 📝
Transform the solution submission experience:

One question per screen
Progress indicator
Smooth transitions
Better solution search/selection
Visual rating selection

Priority 5: Solution Discovery Features 🔍
Enhance how users find solutions:

Filter by solution type on goal pages
Sort options (effectiveness, newest, most reviews)
"Similar solutions" suggestions
Quick preview on hover


🔧 Technical Debt to Address

TypeScript Cleanup

Remove any remaining // @ts-ignore
Properly type all Supabase queries
Fix any any types


Error Handling

Add try-catch to all data fetches
User-friendly error messages
Proper error boundaries


Performance

Check for duplicate API calls
Implement proper caching
Optimize bundle size




💡 Future Considerations
Based on today's work, these features are now possible:

TypeForm-style solution submission
Advanced filtering by solution type
Solution effectiveness comparisons
Mobile app development
API for researchers


📝 Notes for Next Session

Bring: Latest technical reference and this session update
Environment: Dev server runs on port 3002
Key Context: Solutions are now generic with implementation variants
Design System: Using Tailwind CSS with custom animations


🚀 Momentum Status: HIGH
The platform architecture is solid, UI is polished, and we're ready to add powerful features. Search implementation will be a game-changer for discoverability across 549 goals!
