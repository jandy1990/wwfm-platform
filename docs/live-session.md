Live Session Document - June 2025
Session Status
🏗️ Major Architecture Change Implemented
We've fundamentally restructured how solutions work in the database to support:

Generic solutions (one "Vitamin D" entry, not 50 variations)
Multiple implementations (different ways to use the same solution)
Goal-specific effectiveness (same solution can be 5★ for one goal, 1★ for another)
✅ Completed This Session
1. Schema Restructuring (Phases 1-2 Complete)
✅ Added solution_type and solution_fields to solutions table
✅ Created solution_implementations table for variants
✅ Created goal_implementation_links table for goal-specific effectiveness
✅ Added implementation_id to ratings table
✅ Created solution_type_fields configuration table
✅ Cleared old data for fresh start
✅ Removed detailed_steps from everywhere (qualitative data belongs in forums)
2. Key Architecture Decisions
Solutions are generic: No more duplicating "Vitamin D" 50 times
Implementations are variants: "1000 IU daily" vs "5000 IU daily"
Effectiveness is contextual: Rated per goal + implementation combo
Qualitative stories go to forums: Tables only for structured, aggregatable data
3. Form Updates
✅ Updated SolutionForm.tsx to work with new schema
✅ Creates solution → implementation → goal link → rating
✅ Removed detailed_steps (moved to future forums)
✅ Added dynamic fields based on solution type
🤔 Open Questions & Decisions Needed
Solution Type Categories (VERY PRELIMINARY - WILL CHANGE)
Current working categories for MVP:

Dosage-based - Supplements, medications, skincare (need: amount, frequency, timing)
Time-based - Exercise, meditation, therapy (need: duration, frequency, intensity)
Protocol-based - Techniques, methods, routines (need: pattern, steps, triggers)
Resource-based - Products, tools, courses (need: name, cost, where to buy)
⚠️ IMPORTANT: These categories are placeholders! We expect to:

Learn from actual AI content generation what categories make sense
Discover patterns from real submissions
Potentially abandon categories entirely for flexible field collection
Let the data tell us what structure is needed
✅ Additional Progress This Session
Fixed Import Issues:
Resolved TypeScript path resolution errors
Fixed duplicate project directory issue
Updated imports to use relative paths
Installed missing dependencies (@supabase/ssr, lightningcss)
Dev server now running successfully on port 3002
Updated Components:
Created FormField.tsx and Button.tsx components
Updated SolutionForm.tsx with new schema structure
Removed description field from solution creation
Maintained failed solutions section
📋 Next Session Priority (Step 1)
Phase 3: Update Goal Page Display Logic
Update /app/goal/[id]/page.tsx to query using new schema:
Query solutions through goal_implementation_links table
Join with solution_implementations for variants
Display effectiveness per implementation
Show aggregated ratings properly
Current query to replace:
sql
SELECT * FROM solutions WHERE goal_id = ?
New query structure needed:
sql
SELECT solutions via goal_implementation_links
JOIN solution_implementations
GROUP BY solution with aggregated effectiveness
Remaining Steps After Phase 3:
Phase 4: Remove old goal_id from solutions table
Test the flow: Submit test solution through form
Verify all records: Check solution → implementation → link → rating
Begin AI content generation: Start with one arena as test
💡 Key Insights from This Session
Duplication was a fundamental problem - The old schema would have created massive duplication with solutions tied to specific goals
The Triangle Architecture Enhanced - We now properly capture WHO tried WHAT (implementation) for WHICH (goal) with what RESULT (effectiveness)
Structured vs Unstructured - Clear separation: structured data in tables, stories in forums
Solution Types Are Unclear - Unlike goals which were discovered through analysis, solution types need to emerge from actual content
Implementations Enable Aggregation - Can now properly aggregate "2000 IU of Vitamin D worked for 67% of people with SAD"
🚧 Technical Debt & Risks
Solution Type System - Current categories are guesses, likely need major revision
No Migration Path Yet - If we change solution types, how do we migrate?
Display Logic Not Updated - Goal pages still expect old schema
No Test Data - Can't fully validate until we have content
📊 Database State
Solutions table: Empty, ready for new structure
Implementations table: Created, empty
Goal-implementation links: Created, empty
Solution types: 7 basic types defined (likely to change)
🎯 Success Criteria for Next Session
Complete Phase 3-4 of migration
Successfully submit a test solution through form
Display solutions correctly on goal page
Begin AI content generation
Refine solution types based on real content
Session Duration: ~2 hours Major Decision: Complete schema restructure to support generic solutions with variants Biggest Unknown: What solution types/fields we actually need
