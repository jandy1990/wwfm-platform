WWFM Session Transition: 2025-05-18
Document Type: Session transition record
Related Documents: Project Guide | Technical Reference | Collaboration Guide
Status: Current

Accomplishments
Created GitHub repository with comprehensive README
Set up Supabase project with authentication configuration
Created Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Set up environment variables and Supabase client
Successfully deployed to Vercel
Designed comprehensive database schema with:
Post-moderation content approach
Separation of ratings and comments
Progress tracking functionality
Simple reputation/badge system
Created complete documentation structure in GitHub
Key Decisions
Post-moderation content approach - Rationale: Encourages contribution growth while maintaining ability to moderate problematic content; based on successful approach of most social platforms
Comprehensive progress tracking schema - Rationale: Provides future flexibility while starting with simple UI implementation; avoids one-way door data migration issues
Separate ratings (private) from comments (public) - Rationale: Clear privacy model that aligns with platform vision; quantitative data aggregate-only with qualitative public comments
Moderate community features - Rationale: Focus on essential social elements (comments, goal following) while deferring advanced features until user demand is clear
Simple reputation system - Rationale: Encourage engagement without complex gamification; automatic point accumulation with badge levels
Challenges & Solutions
GitHub authentication issues - Solution: Created personal access token for authentication (expires June 17, 2025)
Vercel deployment failures - Solution: Manually specified output directory (.next) to resolve routes-manifest.json error
Database schema design complexity - Solution: Created comprehensive schema document with clear rationale and SQL implementation details
Documentation organization - Solution: Consolidated into three core documents plus session notes for better maintainability
Next Tasks (Prioritized)
Implement database schema in Supabase - Execute SQL statements in Supabase SQL editor to create tables, constraints, and policies
Set up Row Level Security policies - Implement the designed RLS policies to enforce proper data access controls
Create seed data for testing - Add initial arenas, categories, and goals to demonstrate platform functionality
Address open design questions:
Solution variants handling approach
Data richness vs. user friction balance
Begin implementation of authentication UI - Create registration and login pages that connect to Supabase Auth
Open Questions
Solution variants handling: How to model variations of similar solutions? (Options A-D in Technical Reference)
Data richness vs. user friction: What's the right balance for data collection? (Options A-D in Technical Reference)
