Successfully deployed to Vercel
Designed comprehensive database schema with:
Post-moderation content approach
Separation of ratings and comments
Progress tracking functionality
Solution type-specific attributes system
Contextual data collection approach
Enhanced reputation system that rewards complete contributions
Multi-layered user verification strategy
Created complete documentation structure in GitHub
Resolved all major database design decisions
Planned for future equity crowdsourcing business model
Key Decisions
Post-moderation content approach - Rationale: Encourages contribution growth while maintaining ability to moderate problematic content; based on successful approach of most social platforms
Comprehensive progress tracking schema - Rationale: Provides future flexibility while starting with simple UI implementation; avoids one-way door data migration issues
Separate ratings (private) from comments (public) - Rationale: Clear privacy model that aligns with platform vision; quantitative data aggregate-only with qualitative public comments
Moderate community features - Rationale: Focus on essential social elements (comments, goal following) while deferring advanced features until user demand is clear
Solution variants via attributes - Rationale: Flexible approach that handles varying attributes across solution types with powerful filtering capabilities
Contextual + progressive data collection - Rationale: Balance between data quality and user friction with solution-specific required fields and progressive optional fields
Enhanced reputation system - Rationale: Rewards users for providing more complete information, not just quantity of contributions
Multi-layered user verification - Rationale: Combined email verification, CAPTCHA, and registration rate limiting provides strong protection against fake accounts and system gaming with minimal user friction
Contribution-based equity model - Rationale: Aligns platform incentives by enabling greater community ownership through a sliding scale of allocation based on platform contributions
Challenges & Solutions
GitHub authentication issues - Solution: Created personal access token for authentication (expires June 17, 2025)
Vercel deployment failures - Solution: Manually specified output directory (.next) to resolve routes-manifest.json error
Database schema design complexity - Solution: Created comprehensive schema document with clear rationale and SQL implementation details
Documentation organization - Solution: Consolidated into three core documents plus session notes for better maintainability
Solution variants complexity - Solution: Implemented flexible attribute system that handles varying fields across solution types
Data collection vs. user friction - Solution: Combined contextual required fields with progressive optional collection and reputation incentives
User verification balance - Solution: Chose multi-layered verification (email, CAPTCHA, rate limiting) over more intrusive methods like phone verification
Future equity implications - Solution: Designed reputation system to support future equity allocation while keeping immediate focus on platform functionality
Next Tasks (Prioritized)
Implement database schema in Supabase - Execute SQL statements in Supabase SQL editor to create tables, constraints, and policies
Define initial solution types and attributes - Create common solution types with appropriate attributes (e.g., medication, meditation, exercise)
Set up Row Level Security policies - Implement the designed RLS policies to enforce proper data access controls
Implement user verification systems - Integrate reCAPTCHA and IP-based rate limiting on registration
Create seed data for testing - Add initial arenas, categories, goals, and solutions to demonstrate platform functionality
Begin implementation of authentication UI - Create registration and login pages that connect to Supabase Auth
Implementation Plan for Next Session
For our next session, we'll implement the database schema in Supabase:

Step 1: Initial Tables
Create tables in proper dependency order (solution_types first, then arenas, etc.)
Add all columns with appropriate data types and constraints
Verify references and cascade behaviors
Step 2: Functions and Triggers
Create contribution calculation functions
Set up automatic triggers for reputation updates
Implement solution completeness calculator
Step 3: Views
Create effectiveness aggregation views
Set up popular goals view
Establish any other common query patterns
Step 4: RLS Policies
Configure Row Level Security policies for all tables
Test access patterns to verify security model
Ensure proper public/private data separation
Step 5: Seed Data
Define initial solution types with attributes
Create sample arenas, categories, and goals
Add example solutions with varying attributes
