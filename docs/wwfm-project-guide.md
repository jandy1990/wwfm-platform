1. Project Overview
1.1 Purpose
WWFM is a platform that organizes information by what solutions do rather than what they are, helping users discover what has actually worked for others with similar goals. The platform will collect and aggregate user experiences to rank solutions based on their effectiveness.

1.2 Core Value Proposition
Organize information based on goals people want to achieve, not products or services
Provide effectiveness ratings based on real user experiences
Help users find what actually works for their specific goals
Create a community that values evidence over marketing
1.3 Key Differentiators
Goal-centric organization of information
Effectiveness-based ranking
Aggregate real-world experiences
Community-owned platform with ethical data practices
No advertising or selling of user data

3. Core Platform Principles
Based on our discussions and implementation decisions:

Aggregated Wisdom: The platform shows aggregated effectiveness ratings, not individual ratings
Post-Moderation: Content is visible by default with strong flagging/reporting features
Progress Tracking: Users can track their personal journey with solutions
Privacy Model: Quantitative ratings are private (shown only in aggregate), while comments are public with optional anonymity
Data-Driven: All ratings are tied to individual users in the database for analytics and tracking, even though this isn't publicly visible
Moderate Community: Focus on solution comments and goal following with simple reputation system
Contribution Recognition: Simple reputation system that tracks and rewards user contributions through points and badges
User Verification: Multi-layered approach to prevent fake accounts without adding user friction
Community Ownership: Future equity crowdsourcing model that rewards platform contributors
4. Key User Flows

Personalized home screen generation
4.2 User Authentication
Sign in via /auth/signin with email/password
Password reset available via /auth/reset-password
Authentication state managed via React Context
