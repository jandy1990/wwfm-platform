## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
WWFM is a platform that organizes information by what solutions *do* rather than what they *are*, helping users discover what has actually worked for others with similar goals. The platform collects and aggregates user experiences to rank solutions based on their effectiveness.

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition
- Organize information based on goals people want to achieve, not products or services
- Provide effectiveness ratings based on real user experiences
- Help users find what actually works for their specific goals
- Create a community that values evidence over marketing

### 1.3 Key Differentiators
- Goal-centric organization of information
- Effectiveness-based ranking
- Aggregate real-world experiences
- Community-owned platform with ethical data practices
- No advertising or selling of user data

### 2.2 Security Architecture

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Design
Based on lessons learned during development:

1. **Public Read, Private Write Pattern**
   - All approved content is publicly readable
   - Users can only modify their own content
   - Aggregated data (ratings, view counts) must be publicly accessible

2. **Anonymous-First Approach**
   - Most browsing happens without authentication
   - RLS policies must support anonymous read access
   - Authentication required only for contributions

3. **Moderation Through Flags**
   - Use `is_approved` flags rather than RLS for content moderation
   - Allows flexible moderation workflow
   - Maintains simple, predictable RLS policies

## 3. Core Platform Principles

### Updated Based on Implementation Experience:

1. **Aggregated Wisdom**: The platform shows aggregated effectiveness ratings from all users, not individual ratings
2. **Public Knowledge Base**: All approved content is publicly accessible to maximize value
3. **Post-Moderation**: Content is visible by default with strong flagging/reporting features
4. **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their personal journey with solutions
5. **Privacy Model**: 
   - Ratings are submitted privately but shown in aggregate
   - Comments are public with optional anonymity
   - User profiles show contribution stats but not individual ratings
6. **Data Integrity**: All ratings tied to authenticated users to prevent gaming
7. **Community Focus**: Simple reputation system rewards quality contributions
8. **Trust Through Transparency**: Show rating counts and distributions

## 4. Key User Flows

### 4.1 Browse & Discovery Flow ✅ COMPLETE
1. User lands on `/browse` seeing all arenas with icons
2. Clicks arena (e.g., "Health & Wellness") → `/arena/health-wellness`
3. Sees categories within arena → clicks "Weight Loss"
4. Views goals in category → `/category/weight-loss`
5. Clicks specific goal → `/goal/[id]`
6. **Sees solutions with effectiveness ratings** (⭐ 4.5 with count)

### 4.2 User Registration & Onboarding ✅ COMPLETE
1. User signs up with email at `/auth/signup`
2. Email verification via Supabase Auth
3. Account activation and redirect to dashboard
4. Ready to contribute and track progress

### 4.3 Solution Contribution (Next Priority)
1. Authenticated user on goal page
2. Clicks "Share What Worked"
3. Fills out solution details form
4. Submits with `is_approved = false`
5. Moderator review (future)
6. Solution appears for all users

### 4.4 Rating Solutions (Upcoming)
1. User tries a solution
2. Returns to platform to rate
3. Provides effectiveness score (1-5)
4. Adds duration and optional details
5. Rating contributes to aggregate score

## Technical Lessons Learned

### RLS Architecture Insights
1. **Silent Failures**: RLS returns empty data rather than errors - add explicit warnings
2. **Test Anonymous First**: Most users browse without authentication
3. **Separate Complex Queries**: Easier to debug than nested joins
4. **Document Security Model**: Make policies explicit and test regularly

### Development Best Practices
1. **Debug Tools**: Create utilities like `testRLSPolicies()` early
2. **Incremental Progress**: Get core features working before optimization
3. **User-Centric Language**: "What Worked" resonates better than "Solutions"
4. **Real Data Early**: Test with realistic data to catch issues
