WWFM Product Roadmap
Document Type: Strategic planning and feature roadmap
Related Documents: Technical Reference | README
Last Updated: May 31, 2025
Status: Phase 1 MVP 90% Complete

Executive Summary
WWFM is building a platform that organizes solutions by what they do (solve problems) rather than what they are (products/services). We aggregate real user experiences to show what actually works for specific life goals.

Current State: Authentication fixed, core navigation complete, ready to test solution submission.

Vision & Strategic Goals
Platform Vision
Create the world's most trusted source for "what actually worked" by aggregating real experiences from real people solving real problems.

Strategic Objectives
Democratize Wisdom - Make effective solutions freely accessible
Surface Patterns - Identify "keystone solutions" that solve multiple problems
Build Trust - Through transparency and aggregated ratings
Respect Privacy - Individual ratings private, only aggregates shown
