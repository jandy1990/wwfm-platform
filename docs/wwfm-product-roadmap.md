WWFM Product Roadmap
Document Type: Strategic planning and feature roadmap
Related Documents: Technical Reference | README
Last Updated: June 8, 2025
Status: Phase 1 MVP Near Completion, UI Polish Complete

Executive Summary
WWFM is building a platform that organizes solutions by what they do (solve problems) rather than what they are (products/services). We aggregate real user experiences to show what actually works for specific life goals.

Current State: UI dramatically enhanced, search implemented, schema optimized for AI content. Ready for testing and initial content generation.

Vision & Strategic Goals
Platform Vision
Create the world's most trusted source for "what actually worked" by aggregating real experiences from real people solving real problems.

Strategic Objectives
Democratize Wisdom - Make effective solutions freely accessible
Surface Patterns - Identify "keystone solutions" that solve multiple problems
Build Trust - Through transparency and aggregated ratings
Respect Privacy - Individual ratings private, only aggregates shown
Human + AI Collaboration - Demonstrate how AI foundations enable human wisdom
Key Architecture Decision (June 2025)
Generic Solutions with Implementations - One "Vitamin D" entry can have multiple implementations (1000 IU daily, 5000 IU weekly) rated separately for different goals. This prevents duplication and enables true aggregation.
