WWFM Product Roadmap
Document Type: Strategic planning and feature roadmap
Related Documents: Technical Reference | README
Last Updated: December 20, 2024
Status: Phase 1 MVP - Auto-Categorization Complete, Form Implementation In Progress

Executive Summary
WWFM is building a platform that organizes solutions by what they do (solve problems) rather than what they are (products/services). We aggregate real user experiences to show what actually works for specific life goals.

Current State: Auto-categorization system complete with 10,000+ keywords. First form template (DosageForm) implemented and tested. Discovered critical UX insight: users think in solutions, not categories.

Vision & Strategic Goals
Platform Vision
Create the world's most trusted source for "what actually worked" by aggregating real experiences from real people solving real problems.

Strategic Objectives
Democratize Wisdom - Make effective solutions freely accessible
Surface Patterns - Identify "keystone solutions" that solve multiple problems
Build Trust - Through transparency and aggregated ratings
Respect Privacy - Individual ratings private, only aggregates shown
Human + AI Collaboration - Demonstrate how AI foundations enable human wisdom
Key Architecture Decision (December 2024 Update)
Solution-First Discovery - Users expect to find known solutions (like "Headspace") when typing, not choose categories. Implementing smart keyword recognition to show solutions before category detection.

Key Insights & Learnings
December 2024 Discoveries
Users Think in Solutions - "Headspace" not "meditation app category"
Keywords Can Be Solutions - Many keywords ARE product names
Forms Need Context - Showing what we'll ask builds trust
Speed Matters - Debouncing and indexes crucial for feel
What's Working Well
Auto-categorization feels magical when it works
Form templates are the right abstraction
UI animations and polish paying off
Database schema holding up perfectly
Areas for Improvement
Solution discovery needs to come first
Category picker should be last resort
Need all 9 forms for complete experience
Admin tools becoming more urgent
Next Sprint Focus (Late December 2024)
Week 1: Solution-First Search
 Modify auto-categorization to check solutions first
 Implement smart keyword-to-solution recognition
 Update UI to show solutions before categories
 Test with common solution names
Week 2: Complete Form Templates
 Build SessionForm (most common - 7 categories)
 Build PracticeForm (exercise, meditation - 3 categories)
 Build remaining 6 forms
 Test full submission flow for each
Week 3: Polish & Launch Prep
 Admin review queue
 Solution detail pages
 Category browsing pages
 Final testing with beta users
Platform Evolution
From Category-First to Solution-First
The journey from "choose a category" to "we know what Headspace is" represents a fundamental shift in thinking. Users don't categorize - they just know what worked. Our job is to understand them, not train them.

The Magic Number: 9
Nine form templates covering 23 categories proves that complexity can be tamed through thoughtful abstraction. Each form asks exactly what matters for that type of solution.

AI + Human Wisdom
With 513 AI-seeded solutions and a smooth contribution flow, we're proving that AI can provide the foundation for human wisdom to flourish.

Status Summary: Auto-categorization is live and working! One form template is complete and tested. Eight more to go, plus solution-first search, and we'll have a fully functional MVP. The architecture is proven, the UX is smooth, and users are going to love how natural it feels to share what worked.

Projection: MVP complete by end of January 2025, public launch February 2025. ðŸš€
