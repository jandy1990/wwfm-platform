# WWFM Product Roadmap

> **Document Type**: Strategic planning and feature roadmap  
> **Related Documents**: [Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference.md) | [README](/README.md)  
> **Last Updated**: June 2025  
> **Status**: Phase 1 MVP 90% Complete

## Executive Summary

WWFM is building a platform that organizes solutions by what they *do* (solve problems) rather than what they *are* (products/services). We aggregate real user experiences to show what actually works for specific life goals.

**Current State**: Authentication fixed, core navigation complete, AI Foundation strategy defined for cold start.

## Vision & Strategic Goals

### Platform Vision
Create the world's most trusted source for "what actually worked" by aggregating real experiences from real people solving real problems.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Democratize Wisdom** - Make effective solutions freely accessible
2. **Surface Patterns** - Identify "keystone solutions" that solve multiple problems
3. **Build Trust** - Through transparency and aggregated ratings
4. **Respect Privacy** - Individual ratings private, only aggregates shown
5. **Human + AI Collaboration** - Demonstrate how AI foundations enable human wisdom
