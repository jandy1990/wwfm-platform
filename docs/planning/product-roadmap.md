WWFM Product Roadmap
Document Type: Strategic planning and feature roadmap
Related Documents: Technical Reference | README
Last Updated: June 26, 2025
Status: Phase 1 MVP - DosageForm Complete, Fuzzy Search Implemented

Executive Summary
WWFM is building a platform that organizes solutions by what they do (solve problems) rather than what they are (products/services). We aggregate real user experiences to show what actually works for specific life goals.

Current State: Auto-categorization system complete with 10,000+ keywords and fuzzy search capability. First form template (DosageForm v2.2) fully implemented with sophisticated data capture. Failed solutions system working perfectly. Keyword autocomplete with typo tolerance implemented across all search functions.

Vision & Strategic Goals
Platform Vision
Create the world's most trusted source for "what actually worked" by aggregating real experiences from real people solving real problems.

Strategic Objectives
Democratize Wisdom - Make effective solutions freely accessible
Surface Patterns - Identify "keystone solutions" that solve multiple problems
Build Trust - Through transparency and aggregated ratings
Respect Privacy - Individual ratings private, only aggregates shown
Human + AI Collaboration - Demonstrate how AI foundations enable human wisdom
Key Architecture Decision (Validated & Enhanced)
Solution-First Discovery - Users expect to find known solutions (like "Headspace") when typing, not choose categories. Smart keyword recognition with fuzzy matching successfully implemented.

Key Insights & Learnings
June 2025 Discoveries
Typos are Universal - "cereve", "la mere", "the ordnary" are common
Mobile Input Challenges - Small keyboards = more errors
Brand Names Hardest - L'Oreal, Kiehl's, Dr. Jart+ easy to misspell
Conservative Matching Works - 40% threshold catches typos, not gibberish
Users Expect Intelligence - Modern apps handle typos gracefully
What's Working Well

Platform Evolution
From Good to Great
The journey from basic forms to sophisticated data capture with typo tolerance shows our commitment to user experience. DosageForm v2.2 + fuzzy search demonstrates that we can capture nuanced health data while keeping the UX delightful.

The Power of Smart Search
Fuzzy matching isn't just a nice-to-have - it's essential for data quality at scale. Without it, we'd have dozens of variations of each product. With it, we have clean, searchable, aggregatable data.

Ready for Scale
With the architecture proven, first form polished, and fuzzy search preventing data pollution, we're ready to rapidly implement the remaining forms and launch to users who need real answers to real problems.

Status Summary: DosageForm proves our form architecture works beautifully. Failed solutions add the missing piece - what DIDN'T work. Fuzzy search ensures data quality from day one. 8 more forms stand between us and launch. The foundation is rock solid and intelligent.

Projection: MVP complete by end of July 2025, public launch August 2025. ðŸš€
