1. Handover Principles
1.1 Core Philosophy
Assume zero context carryover between sessions. Every handover must provide complete context for seamless continuation by a new Claude instance with no memory of previous interactions.

1.2 Critical Success Factors
Preserve all working configurations - Environment variables, file paths, dependencies
Document implementation decisions - Why specific approaches were chosen over alternatives
Capture exact current state - What's working, what's broken, what's next
Provide actionable next steps - Specific files to create, exact code to implement
Record all technical debt - Known issues, workarounds, future improvements needed
1.3 Handover Triggers
Execute full handover process when:

User explicitly requests handover ("let's handover", "update documentation")
Session approaching length limits (>50 exchanges)
Major milestone completed (authentication, database, core feature)
Significant technical decision made that affects architecture
User mentions they will be ending the session
2. Pre-Handover Checklist
2.1 Information Gathering Phase
Before creating handover documents, collect:

✅ Session Accomplishments

 What specific features/components were implemented?
 Which files were created or modified?
 What technical challenges were overcome?
 Which integrations were tested and verified working?
✅ Technical Decisions Made

 What architectural choices were made?
 Which alternatives were considered and rejected?
 What was the reasoning behind each decision?
 Are there any decisions that might need revisiting?
✅ Current System State

 What is currently working and tested?
 What is partially implemented?
 What is broken or needs fixing?
 What environment setup is required?
✅ Immediate Next Steps

 What should be the very next implementation priority?
 Which files need to be created next?
 What specific code needs to be written?
 Are there any blocking dependencies?
2.2 Context Assessment

Mark with clear visual indicators (🚨, ❗, CRITICAL)
Explain why the item blocks other development
Provide exact implementation steps
Include estimated time to completion
🔴 High Priority Items:

Essential for core functionality
Should be next focus area after critical items
Include implementation approach and file locations
Note any dependencies or prerequisites
🟡 Medium Priority Items:

Important for user experience or technical debt
Can be scheduled after high priority items
Include brief implementation notes
Note any opportunities for parallel development
🟢 Low Priority Items:

Nice-to-have features or optimizations
Can be deferred without impact
Include basic implementation outline
Note any dependencies on higher priority items
Template Usage Instructions
For Each Session Handover:
Copy the Session Transition Document Template (Section 3.1)
Fill in all required sections using the standards in this guide
Update Primary Documents (Project Guide, Technical Reference) using Section 4 criteria
Verify Context Preservation using Section 5 checklists
Review Technical Detail Level using Section 6 guidelines
Confirm Handover Completeness using Section 2 checklist
Quality Assurance Check:
Before completing handover, ask: "Could a new Claude instance with zero prior context successfully continue this project using only these documents?"

If the answer is not a confident "yes," additional context documentation is required.
