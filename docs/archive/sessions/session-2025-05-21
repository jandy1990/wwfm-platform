> **Document Type**: Session transition record  
> **Related Documents**: [Project Guide](/docs/wwfm-project-guide.md) | [Technical Reference](/docs/wwfm-technical-reference.md) | [Collaboration Guide](/docs/wwfm-collaboration-guide.md)  
> **Status**: Ready for Next Session

## Accomplishments
- Successfully implemented the database schema in Supabase
- Created all tables with proper foreign key relationships
- Fixed and implemented functions and triggers:
  - Solution completeness calculation function
  - User contribution point system with quality incentives
  - Badge level determination
- Set up Row Level Security policies for all tables
- Created initial seed data:
  - Solution types (Medication, Meditation, Exercise)
  - Type-specific attributes with appropriate data types
  - Sample arenas, categories, and goals
- Tested the complete system functionality:
  - User account creation
  - Solution creation with attributes
  - Rating system
  - Point calculation system
  - Relationship queries

## Key Decisions
- **Renamed function parameters** - Rationale: Renamed ambiguous parameter names (solution_id to solution_id_param) to avoid column reference issues in the database
- **Enhanced trigger functionality** - Rationale: Modified triggers to properly identify different ID fields (user_id vs created_by) based on table context
- **Added safeguards to calculations** - Rationale: Added NULLIF and COALESCE to prevent division by zero errors and handle edge cases
- **Renamed problematic trigger** - Rationale: Created trigger with alternative name (solution_attributes_after_change) to avoid naming conflicts

## Challenges & Solutions
- **User ID field inconsistency** - Solution: Created a consistent variable approach in functions to handle different field names (created_by vs user_id)
- **Ambiguous column references** - Solution: Renamed parameters in functions to avoid conflicts with column names
- **Trigger creation conflicts** - Solution: Used DROP TRIGGER with explicit table references and created triggers with new names to resolve conflicts
- **Proper dependency management** - Solution: Identified the correct order for dropping and recreating database objects to respect dependencies

## Next Tasks (Prioritized)
1. **Implement authentication UI** - Create user registration and login pages that connect to Supabase Auth
2. **Develop goal browsing interface** - Build UI for browsing goals by arena and category
3. **Create solution browsing interface** - Implement the solution discovery experience with effectiveness sorting
4. **Build solution creation forms** - Create dynamic forms that adapt to different solution types
5. **Implement rating and review UI** - Develop the interface for rating solutions and tracking progress

## Implementation Plan for Next Session
For our next session, we'll focus on implementing the authentication UI:

1. **Step 1: Set up Auth Components**
   - Create reusable authentication components
   - Implement form validation with proper error handling
   - Design responsive layouts for auth screens

2. **Step 2: Registration Flow**
   - Implement email verification process
   - Create multi-step registration with progressive data collection
   - Add reCAPTCHA integration for bot prevention

3. **Step 3: Login System**
   - Implement secure login with proper session management
   - Create password reset functionality
   - Design authentication state persistence

4. **Step 4: User Profile**
   - Build editable user profile UI
   - Create contribution stats display
   - Implement badge visualization

5. **Step 5: Authentication Context**
   - Set up React context for auth state management
   - Create protected routes for authenticated content
   - Implement role-based UI adaptation

## Notes on Database Schema Updates
During implementation, we made the following adjustments to the original schema:
- Renamed function parameters to avoid column reference ambiguity
- Added NULLIF checks to prevent division by zero errors
- Created a unified approach for handling different ID field names
