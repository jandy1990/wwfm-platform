WWFM Live Session Handover
Date: June 2025
Component: Auto-categorization & Fuzzy Search
Status: Fuzzy matching implemented across all search functions
üéØ Session Accomplishments
1. ‚úÖ Previous Session Recap (DosageForm v2.2)

Restructured dosage form flow with better UX
Removed confusing Count field
Separated units from forms properly
Expanded cost ranges for expensive medications
Custom side effects with "Other" option
Beauty/skincare special handling
Failed solutions backend implementation

2. ‚úÖ Fuzzy Search Implementation (NEW)
Goal: Handle typos and misspellings in user input across the platform
What We Built:

pg_trgm Extension: Enabled PostgreSQL trigram matching for fuzzy search
Three Fuzzy Functions:

search_keywords_for_autocomplete - Finds keywords even with typos
search_solutions_fuzzy - Finds existing solutions with misspellings
check_keyword_match_fuzzy - Detects categories despite typos


40% Similarity Threshold: Conservative setting that catches obvious typos
Match Quality Indicators: Shows "(similar)" for fuzzy matches vs exact

SQL Implementation:
sql-- Enabled pg_trgm extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;

-- Created indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_solutions_title_trgm ON solutions USING gin (LOWER(title) gin_trgm_ops);

-- Functions handle case-insensitive fuzzy matching
-- Example: "cereve" finds "CeraVe" with 0.40 match score
3. ‚úÖ TypeScript Integration
Updated Files:

lib/services/auto-categorization.ts

Added KeywordMatch interface with matchScore
Updated all search functions to use fuzzy RPC calls
Added searchKeywordSuggestions function
Returns keyword matches for autocomplete


components/solutions/SolutionFormWithAutoCategory.tsx

Added keyword suggestions dropdown section
Shows fuzzy match indicators
Click to fill input with correct spelling
Already had handleSelectKeywordSuggestion ready



4. ‚úÖ Server Component Error Fix

Resolved "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props"
Made onCancel prop optional
Uses router.back() when no handler provided

üìù How Fuzzy Search Works
User Experience:

User types "the ordnary" (misspelled)
System finds "The Ordinary" via fuzzy matching
Shows suggestion with category badge
User clicks ‚Üí Input filled with correct spelling
Prevents duplicate entries like "la mer", "La Mer", "LaMer"

Technical Flow:
User input ‚Üí Fuzzy search (40% threshold) ‚Üí Scored matches ‚Üí UI display
"cereve" ‚Üí similarity('cerave', 'cereve') = 0.40 ‚Üí Show suggestion
Match Scoring:

1.0 = Exact match (case insensitive)
0.9 = Starts with search term
0.8 = Contains exact substring
0.4+ = Fuzzy match threshold

üîß Testing the Implementation
Quick Tests:
‚úì "la mere" ‚Üí Suggests "La Mer"
‚úì "cereve" ‚Üí Suggests "CeraVe"  
‚úì "the ordnary" ‚Üí Suggests "The Ordinary"
‚úì "vitamn d" ‚Üí Suggests "Vitamin D"
‚úì "headpsace" ‚Üí Suggests "Headspace"
Full User Flow:

Go to any goal page
Click "Share What Worked"
Start typing with typos
See autocomplete suggestions
Click suggestion ‚Üí Correct spelling filled
Continue to appropriate form

üí° Important Context
Why Fuzzy Search Matters

Mobile Users: Typing on phones leads to more typos
Product Names: Beauty brands especially (L'Oreal, Kiehl's, Dr. Jart+)
Data Quality: Prevents "Vitamin D", "vitamin d", "Vit D" duplicates
User Confidence: Shows we understand what they meant

Performance Considerations

Indexes on LOWER(title) for fast trigram matching
10,000 keywords is tiny for pg_trgm
Conservative threshold prevents false positives
Limits results to 10 for quick response

üöÄ Ready for Testing
All fuzzy search features are working:

‚úÖ Keyword autocomplete with typo handling
‚úÖ Solution search with misspellings
‚úÖ Category detection despite errors
‚úÖ Visual indicators for match quality

üìã Remaining Work
Immediate:

None - fuzzy search is complete and working

Next Sprint Priorities:

Complete Remaining Forms (8 of 9 remaining)

SessionForm (7 categories) - NEXT PRIORITY
PracticeForm (3 categories)
Others as outlined in form templates

üéâ Session Summary
Transformed the platform from exact-match-only to intelligent fuzzy search that handles real-world typing. Combined with the completed DosageForm v2.2, users now have a sophisticated yet simple contribution experience. The foundation is rock solid for scaling to remaining forms.
Time invested: ~2 hours
Impact: Dramatically improved data quality and user experience
Status: Fuzzy search complete, ready for form development sprint
