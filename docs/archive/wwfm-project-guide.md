## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
WWFM is a platform that organizes information by what solutions *do* rather than what they *are*, helping users discover what has actually worked for others with similar goals. The platform collects and aggregates user experiences to rank solutions based on their effectiveness, while revealing deeper patterns that lead to lasting transformation.

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition
- **Organize by outcomes**: Information sorted by goals people want to achieve, not products or services
- **Effectiveness-based ranking**: Real user experiences, not marketing claims
- **Root cause recognition**: Surface "keystone solutions" that address multiple problems
- **Pattern intelligence**: Reveal virtuous cycles where positive changes reinforce each other
- **Holistic impact**: Show how solutions affect multiple life areas
- **Community wisdom**: Aggregate experiences to find high-percentage plays
- **Ethical data practices**: Community-owned platform with no advertising

### 1.3 Key Differentiators
- Goal-centric organization (what you want to achieve, not what to buy)
- Effectiveness-based ranking from real experiences
- Keystone solution identification (practices that solve multiple problems)
- Life impact visualization (see effects across all life areas)
- Virtuous cycle recognition (understand reinforcing patterns)
- Natural language taxonomy (459 goals in words people actually use)
- Wisdom cultivation alongside symptom relief
- No advertising or selling of user data

### 2.2 Security Architecture

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Design
Based on lessons learned during development:

1. **Public Read, Private Write Pattern**
   - All approved content is publicly readable
   - Users can only modify their own content
   - Aggregated data (ratings, view counts) must be publicly accessible

2. **Anonymous-First Approach**
   - Most browsing happens without authentication
   - RLS policies must support anonymous read access
   - Authentication required only for contributions

3. **Moderation Through Flags**
   - Use `is_approved` flags rather than RLS for content moderation
   - Allows flexible moderation workflow
   - Maintains simple, predictable RLS policies

## 3. Core Platform Principles

### 3.1 Original Principles (Maintained)

1. **Aggregated Wisdom**: Show collective effectiveness ratings, not individual opinions
2. **Public Knowledge Base**: All approved content publicly accessible to maximize value
3. **Post-Moderation**: Content visible by default with strong flagging/reporting
4. **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their personal journey with solutions
5. **Privacy Model**: Ratings submitted privately but shown in aggregate
6. **Data Integrity**: All ratings tied to authenticated users to prevent gaming
7. **Community Focus**: Simple reputation system rewards quality contributions
8. **Trust Through Transparency**: Show rating counts and distributions

### 3.2 Philosophical Enhancements (Added May 28, 2025)

9. **Root Cause Recognition**: Surface "keystone solutions" that address multiple problems
10. **Holistic Integration**: Show how solutions impact multiple life areas
11. **Pattern Intelligence**: Reveal sequences and dependencies between successful changes
12. **Wisdom Over Symptoms**: Guide users from quick fixes to lasting transformation

### 3.3 Solution Principles (Added May 28-29, 2025)

13. **Mechanism Over Method**: Solutions work through underlying mechanisms (BDNF increase, stress reduction), not the specific method
14. **Compound Power**: Multi-mechanism solutions (marked as compound) provide exponential benefits
15. **Minimum Viable Dose**: Every solution has an accessible entry point - 5 minutes of meditation beats 0 minutes
16. **Natural Progressions**: Solutions exist in clusters with natural progression paths (walking → hiking → trail running)
17. **Success Rate Transparency**: Show what percentage of people found each solution effective (not just popular)

## 4. Key User Flows

### 4.1 Browse & Discovery Flow ✅ COMPLETE
1. User lands on `/browse` seeing all arenas with icons
2. Clicks arena (e.g., "Feel better emotionally") → `/arena/feel-better-emotionally`
3. Views goals in natural language → "Stop feeling overwhelmed all the time"
4. Clicks specific goal → `/goal/[id]`
5. Sees solutions with effectiveness ratings (⭐ 4.5 with count)
6. Views keystone badges on high-impact solutions

4. Form includes:
   - Basic details (title, description)
   - Effectiveness rating (required)
   - Timeline to results (required)

## 6. Platform Philosophy

### 6.1 From Symptom Management to Wisdom Cultivation

WWFM has evolved from simply cataloging "what worked" to understanding WHY things work and how they connect. This philosophical enhancement doesn't replace our user-first approach—it deepens it.

### 6.2 The Aristotelian Insight

A philosophical review revealed that most self-help platforms treat symptoms rather than causes. WWFM's opportunity is to be both:
- **Immediate**: Address pressing problems where users are
- **Transformative**: Reveal patterns that create lasting change

### 6.3 The Solution Mapping Insight (May 28 Evening)

Our solution mapping exercise revealed critical patterns:
- **Solutions cluster naturally**: Movement, mindfulness, biohacking, social, cognitive, recovery, nutrition, productivity, and purpose
- **Hub solutions connect clusters**: Breathwork, yoga, and journaling bridge multiple domains
- **Mechanisms matter more than methods**: Understanding HOW solutions work (BDNF increase, stress reduction) is more important than WHAT they are
- **Organic emergence over exhaustive mapping**: The platform will build its superior map through aggregated human experience

### 6.4 Balancing Accessibility with Depth

We maintain our commitment to:
- Starting where users are (specific, emotional problems)
- Using natural, accessible language
- Providing immediate value
- Respecting user agency

While adding:
- Pattern recognition from collective data
- Root cause awareness through keystone solutions
- Integration opportunities across life areas
- Optional deeper wisdom for those ready
- Mechanism understanding for informed choices

### 6.5 The 9 Arenas

Based on emotion-first user research:
1. 🧠 Feel better emotionally
2. ❤️ Build meaningful connections
3. 🎯 Take control of my life
4. 💼 Achieve career success
5. 🏃 Improve physical health
6. 🌱 Grow as a person
7. 🌐 Navigate modern challenges
8. 🏡 Create a home that works
9. 🎨 Express myself creatively
