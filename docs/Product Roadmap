WWFM Product Roadmap
Document Type: Strategic planning and feature roadmap
Related Documents: Technical Reference | README
Last Updated: June 2025
Status: Phase 1 MVP Architecture Complete, Display Logic Next

Executive Summary
WWFM is building a platform that organizes solutions by what they do (solve problems) rather than what they are (products/services). We aggregate real user experiences to show what actually works for specific life goals.

Current State: Major schema restructure complete, generic solutions with variants implemented, ready for display logic updates and AI content generation.

Vision & Strategic Goals
Platform Vision
Create the world's most trusted source for "what actually worked" by aggregating real experiences from real people solving real problems.

Strategic Objectives
Democratize Wisdom - Make effective solutions freely accessible
Surface Patterns - Identify "keystone solutions" that solve multiple problems
Build Trust - Through transparency and aggregated ratings
Respect Privacy - Individual ratings private, only aggregates shown
Human + AI Collaboration - Demonstrate how AI foundations enable human wisdom
Key Architecture Decision (June 2025)
Generic Solutions with Implementations - One "Vitamin D" entry can have multiple implementations (1000 IU daily, 5000 IU weekly) rated separately for different goals. This prevents duplication and enables true aggregation.

Hook: "Don't just know what works - know exactly how"
AI Angle: "AI suggests options, humans prove what works"
Content Strategy
Blog: "Why 2000 IU failed but 5000 IU changed my life"
Social: Before/after implementation comparisons
SEO: Target "best dosage for X" searches

Open Questions (Updated)
Implementation similarity - When are two variants too similar?
Auto-generation - Should AI suggest implementation variants?
Voting on variants - Community curation of best implementations?
Mobile UX - How to show variants elegantly?
Search complexity - Search solutions or implementations?
Forum integration - Per solution or per implementation?
Next Milestone Checklist
 Update goal page queries for new schema
 Test solution submission flow
 Create 10 test solutions with variants
 Generate AI content for one arena
 Refine solution categories based on data
 Launch internal testing
Next Critical Step: Update display logic to show solutions with implementation variants on goal pages. This unlocks everything else.
